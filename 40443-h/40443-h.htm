<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>In presenting this volume to the "intelligence
of the world," the author is fully aware of the
incredulity with which it may meet in many
literary minds. Nevertheless, the truths which it contains
will remain unmarred by the salient attacks of
"critics," when they have passed away and have ceased
to be remembered. Thus it has ever been with the
discovery of all great and important truths, from the
creation of man down to the present day. For more
than eighteen hundred years now past, the succession
of a once prominent race have disbelieved in the Messiahship
of Christ. And even the Christian world are
still divided in their belief as to a Trinity in Unity.</p>

<p>Some three hundred years ago, the great and learned
philosopher and astronomer, Galileo, made an ascent in
the empire of mind and science, and promulgated immutable
truths founded upon the laws of creation, emanating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
from God himself; yet these were, for a time,
disbelieved, and, through the bigotry of a controlling
Priesthood, he was even forced to renounce them before
a court of "Cardinals" of the Romish Church, sitting
as "<i>inquisitors against heretical depravity</i>" at the city
of Rome; and at the venerable age of seventy years, to
accept the sentence to a dungeon for life, in the "Inquisition;"
and yet these same truths have universally
prevailed. So, also, are there unbelievers to-day, in
the existence of a God, and the immortality of the
soul&mdash;the truth of which all Christians, and even heathens,
believe.</p>

<p>We, therefore, feel that in advancing a new theory,
especially one of such magnitude and import, that we
shall meet more or less opposition; but we are willing
to abide time's inevitable changes, in advancing the
mind to grasp and comprehend truths which God himself
has revealed for our contemplation. Still, we believe
that there are many millions who are now ready
to comprehend and believe, and are only waiting for a
little additional light, or the grouping together of facts
founded on the revelations of God, and examined in
the light of a true science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>Philosophers and astronomers have advanced the
idea of "a plurality of suns, and a plurality of worlds,"
and have sustained this theory by the most convincing
evidence. This lays the foundation for a further advance
in the contemplation of the wonderful works of
the Creator, and justifies the hypothesis of a <i>plurality
of heavens</i>; and we think the revelations of God, and
revelations through the science of astronomy, will
sustain the additional hypothesis that within what are
denominated "suns" there are vast globes or worlds,
separate and apart from the surrounding <i>photosphere of
ethereal fire</i>, and that within what we denominate our
sun, <i>is our heaven</i>.</p>

<p>We have, therefore, penned the following pages with
this impression fixed in our mind, and send this volume
forth to encounter the enlightenment of the age, to be
sifted and weighed in the <i>sieve</i> and <i>scale</i> of intellect;
and, relying on the Word of God and His revelations
to man, we feel satisfied that when the ordeal is past,
we shall still have remaining "full measure and weight."</p>

<p>In order to afford a more perfect comprehension of
the "wonderful works of God," and of His revelations
to man, we have, necessarily, availed ourselves largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
of the results of the science of astronomy, quoting the
writings and conclusions of various eminent authors,
giving due credit therefor; and to them the author acknowledges
his indebtedness for statistical data and
facts which could not otherwise be obtained by any
single individual. Grouping these together as assistant
lamps, we have relied, mainly, upon the Word of God,
and His revelations, as found recorded in the Bible,
and evidences manifest in perceptible and visible nature
around us, while we trust that all we have written
will the more forcibly impress the mind with deep humility,
and with awe and reverence for the Great Jehovah,
who created all by the "Word of His power."</p>

<p>We have endeavored to avoid sectarian issues, as to
Protestant communities, throughout the world&mdash;save
our own convictions of immutable truth in regard to the
true principles of Christianity, and that salvation is
offered alike freely to <i>all</i>, and that by due repentance
toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, all may
come to the knowledge of His Truth, and "know the
Lord, whom to know aright is eternal life." And, believing
as we do, that every soul is held alike accountable
to God alone&mdash;and in nowise to Pope, Bishops, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
Priests&mdash;there were historical facts connected with our
subject, which, we thought, justified our strictures on
the Romish Church, and these it may be well for Protestants
to consider.</p>

<p>We, therefore, dedicate this volume to the</p>

<p class="center">
PROTESTANT WORLD,<br />
</p>

<p>and, while we acknowledge our inability to do the subject
ample justice; yet&mdash;hoping we have been made
the humble instrument, under the direction of Divine
Providence, of opening up to the mind a new field for
profitable contemplation&mdash;we ask for it a candid perusal,
in the spirit of prayer and Christian leniency, commending
all to a careful consideration of the words of
the <i>Psalmist</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>"By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and
all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.</p>

<p>"The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
sheweth His handy work.</p>

<p>"Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they
shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE THEME.</h2>


<p>The theme we are now about to contemplate is
one of deepest interest to the human mind. If
we can fathom and unfold the mystery&mdash;as we
believe we shall&mdash;by analogy, founded in the light of
<i>reason</i>, Divine revelations, and the lights afforded us by
the science of Astronomy, and give tangibility to the&mdash;hitherto&mdash;chaos
of the mind upon the subject, we may
lay the foundation for a more comprehensive and intimate
knowledge of God, the great Creator of all things,
and this knowledge should lead to more speedily Christianizing
the world.</p>

<p>God has made himself manifest in everything, and
to every individual. Nature yields to this manifestation,
yet does not comprehend it. Even man, the human
family&mdash;the only creatures of a high order of intelligence
placed by Him upon this earth&mdash;seem not to have
risen to that comprehension of knowledge to which they
should attain from his lessons of the Past, as well as
those of the Present, and which lessons are renewed
unto us day by day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Our principal theme is that of <i>the place of our future
existence&mdash;especially</i> <span class="smcap">Heaven</span>.</p>

<p>We approach the subject with fear and trembling,
asking wisdom and Divine aid of Him who hath said,
"Seek and ye shall find," and of whom it is written,
"If any lack wisdom, let him ask of God, and it shall
be given him."</p>

<p>We know that we cannot throw that flood-tide of
light upon the subject that the theme demands, yet we
may be the humble instrument, under direction of
Divine Providence, to mark out a path through the wilderness
of doubt, along which may shine, or through
which the "eye of faith" may catch, a ray of light from
the bright "celestial throne," which may induce others&mdash;more
able minds and giant intellects&mdash;to step forth,
wielding mightily "the sword of the spirit," and open
out to the mind a plainer path, as the "king's highway,"
leading up to that celestial world, to glory and to God.</p>

<p>We believe that if a reasonable, tangible idea of the
constant presence of God with us prevailed, as also of
the heavenly world, and the glories that shall be
revealed; the nature of the soul of man; from whence
derived; the certainty that it must endure forever; the
requirements of the law of God; the certainty of the
judgment; who is to be the judge; the certainty that no
error can be committed in His judgment; no influences
can be brought to bear to defeat the ends of justice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
that the righteous shall be adjudged to the enjoyment
of happiness and eternal life; the wicked be
"banished from the presence of God, and from the
glory of His power," "to dwell in everlasting flame,
and languish in eternal fire," and that this righteous
judgment will never be revoked, but stand immutable
as God Himself&mdash;on and on through all eternity&mdash;we
say we believe if this could be fully comprehended by
finite minds, the time would not be distant "when all
<i>would</i> come to a knowledge of the truth, and know the
Lord, whom to know aright is eternal life." This
knowledge should not be sought through fear alone,
but mainly through love to God, and faith in His Son,
our Lord Jesus Christ, and from the delights we feel
in our consciousness of the constant presence of God&mdash;by
His Spirit&mdash;with us; stimulated by love to our
fellow-men; love of all Nature around us; love of the
wonderful works of the creative power of the Omnipotent&mdash;even
the vast wonders of His creations throughout
His own native Empire.</p>

<p>May we not? Can we not know more of all this?
We are not forbidden to investigate, to found reason on
His revelations. Nay, He hath said, "search the
Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life,
and these are they which testify of Me."</p>

<p>We do not propose the building of a "Tower" like
unto that of <i>Babel</i>, for He hath said, "not by <i>might</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but by my <i>Spirit</i>." Therefore, by the manifestations
of His Spirit, which becomes sufficiently enlightening,
when properly comprehended, we will endeavor to
throw a faint&mdash;if not a flood-light from that eternal
world into the eye of <i>faith</i>. And, if we cannot, like
the martyr Stephen, "see Heaven opened, and the Son
of man standing at the right hand of God," or ascend
to it with "Elijah in a chariot of flaming fire," we may,
by the mind's eye of faith, "see through the vail darkly,"
yet with sufficient light to direct us, and guide our wandering
footsteps in the path that leads to that "bright
clime," where the "glory of God" is the light of that
heavenly world.</p>

<p>Our theme necessarily leads us forth through trackless
realms of boundless space, where, with the mind's
eye, we shall behold with wonder and amazement some
of the vast creations of the Omnipotent power of God;
such as will inspire the mind, and fill it with awe and
reverence for the Great Jehovah. We shall have a
panoramic view of millions of Suns&mdash;<i>Heavens</i>&mdash;planets,
and worlds, standing out, or careering through ethereal
regions; peopling the realms of illimitable space. We
shall comprehend more fully the diminutiveness of this
earth; on which we dwell, as compared to the vast creations
brought forth by the "Word of His power," and
of our own nothingness before Him, while all must inspire
us, not only with awe, but with gratitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
love for His merciful provision for our redemption, and
for regaining "an inheritance which is incorruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, AND A<br />
FUTURE STATE OF EXISTENCE.</i></h2>


<p>The Bible&mdash;now "The Book of the World"&mdash;is
God's own revelation to man. That it was
penned by holy men of God, who wrote as they
were inspired, has been fully manifested by the fulfilment
of prophecies; many of which were miracles, and
others&mdash;in their accomplishment&mdash;awful and fearful
judgments. Hence, none can doubt its authenticity as
God's own revelation to man. It is our only history
of the wonderful creations emanating from the Great
First Cause; especially the creation of <i>man</i>; his mortal,
as well as his immortal nature. From this history
we learn that</p>

<blockquote><p>"God created man in his own image; in the image of
God created he him; male and female created he them.
And God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and
man became a living soul."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, man is here spoken of in the plural: hence, the
whole race&mdash;the entire human family, are included, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
this living principle, emanating from God himself, partakes
of his own immortal nature, and can never cease
or be extinguished. Therefore, the soul, or spirit of
man, must continue to endure through all eternity.</p>

<p>The belief in a future state of existence has obtained
in all ages; even in the dark regions of heathen
lands, where the light of Christianity has never yet shed
its radiance, and where missionaries have never penetrated.
The mind of man&mdash;the thinking principle of
human intelligence&mdash;seems to have comprehended this
great truth; even where Christianity, founded upon
Bible truths, is unknown. Indeed, the idea of the immortality
of the soul of man seems <i>inherent</i>. For, go
where we may, among the aborigines of every heathen
clime, even from the Islands of the Bahamas to Hindostan,
India, Japan, and China; the savage tribes of
South America, the red tribes of our own continent,
or even the black races of Africa&mdash;all hold the idea of
a future state of existence. True, they may not have
formed correct opinions as to the nature of the place to
which they expect to be transported, nor of the felicities
to be enjoyed there; yet all have the idea of a future
state, and it has ever prevailed.</p>

<p>If we trace history back to the ancient Egyptians,
the Persians, the Scythians, the Assyrians, Greeks, and
Romans; indeed, with all nations of which history gives
us any knowledge, we find that it has ever prevailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Plato, Socrates, and Demosthenes held the doctrine of
the immortality of the soul, and of a future state of existence;
while such belief almost universally prevails
in every land and clime where civilization and Christianity
are known. Thus we see it an inherent law of
human nature, and, in the minds of all, there is "a
longing after <i>immortality</i>."</p>

<p>May we not ask, from whence comes this intuition,
that all feel that death to the body is not the end of
existence? Is it not that immortal spirit-life which
God breathed into our first parents? that <i>spirit-fire</i>
which is eternal in its nature? that which can never be
quenched nor extinguished?</p>

<p>The Patriarchs, the Prophets, and Seers of old
realized that here they had no abiding place, and that
they were but pilgrims and strangers on the earth. We
are told that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob desired a better
country, and looked forward to a heavenly one.
Paul tells us "these all died in the faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them afar off."
See how Moses submitted to sufferings, and endured
privations; yet in all these he "had respect unto the
recompense of reward."</p>

<p>How many of those worthy ancients suffered persecutions
in various ways for their acts of piety? even
cruel mockings, scourgings, bonds, and imprisonments.
Some were cruelly tortured, others were stoned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
still others sawed asunder; and yet under all these
trials, and even scourgings unto death, they held firm
in the faith of a living God, a future existence, and "a
sure recompense of reward."</p>

<p>See Job, that faithful servant of the living God,
how his faith was sorely tried by all manner of
afflictions. His flocks and herds destroyed; his
wealth dissipated; while disease, painful and loathsome,
preyed upon him. His sufferings and agonies
were so intense that all his friends believed him
cursed of God, and forsook him; and even his wife&mdash;who
had enjoyed the fruits of his efforts in life, reviled
his integrity of faith, and scornfully told him to "curse
God and die."</p>

<p>But let us hear this patient, suffering child of God:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>True</i>, my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of
dust; my skin is broken and become loathsome, and I feel
as though I would not live alway. Yet all the days of my
appointed time will I wait, until my change comes, <i>and
even</i> though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him. I know
that I shall be justified. For He shall be my salvation. If
a man die he shall live again. And now, behold my witness
is in heaven, and my record is on high. For I know that
my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand in the latter
day upon the earth. And though worms destroy this body,
yet in my flesh shall I see God, whom I shall see for myself,
and mine eyes shall behold."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Where! oh, where, hath such faith been shown!
And his faith being sorely tried and found true and unwavering,
his God came to his relief, restored him to
health, and blessed him&mdash;even more abundantly than
before; after which he lived an hundred and forty
years and died in peace.</p>

<p>Here we see, that, long anterior to the coming of
Christ, Job declared that he knew his Redeemer was
then living, and that in the "latter days" he should
"stand on the earth." See this truthful evidence of the
Son of God coming down from heaven to ransom and
redeem fallen man!</p>

<p>The prophets foretold the coming of the Messiah,
who should "ransom his people from the power of the
grave," and "redeem them from the second death."</p>

<p>The sweet singer of Israel, looking forward to coming
ages, through the vista of revelations, breaks forth
in rapturous confidence&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward
receive me to glory. Whom have I in heaven but thee,
and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
Though my heart and my flesh fail me, yet Thou art the
strength of my heart and my portion forever."</p></blockquote>

<p>The prophet Isaiah declares,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body
shall they arise."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>And, calling in spirit unto the silent dead, he saith:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust, * * the
earth shall cast out her dead."</p></blockquote>

<p>In fulfilment of prophesy, the Son of God came as
the "plague of death" and "destruction of the grave."
His advent into the world was signalized by a "star in
the East," guiding the wise men&mdash;who were looking for
his coming&mdash;to the "town of Bethlehem, where lay the
babe in the manger." While an angel, commissioned
by the Father, announced his arrival, and "good tidings
of great joy" to the shepherds who were watching
their flocks by night upon the plains of Judea, saying,
"Unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,
which is Christ the Lord." "And suddenly there
was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host,
praising God," and, as a heavenly choir, sounding the
loud anthem, "Glory to God in the highest, and on
earth peace, good will toward men." This was "Him
of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets did write,"
even the "Sun of righteousness," whose coming was
foretold by the prophet Malachi.</p>

<p>By his teachings, and miracles wrought in after life,
he proved his origin and mission. But this mission
could not be fully accomplished until he should conquer
death, hell, and the grave, and "bring life and immortality
to light through his own Gospel." Finally, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
day and the hour came for its complete fulfilment.
Borne down with the weight of the sins of a guilty
world, he prayed his Father to strengthen him, while
"in agony he sweat great drops of blood."</p>

<p>See him ascending the rugged steeps of Calvary,
bearing his own cross, upon which his human nature
must expire between Heaven and Earth. Nailed to
that cross, he hung upon it in painful agony, and for
three dreadful hours the sun, the source of light, was
veiled, "and there was darkness over all the land," and
about the ninth hour, his humanity "cried with a loud
voice, my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!"
and gave up the ghost. "And behold the vail of the
temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom;
and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent, and the
graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints
which slept, arose."</p>

<p>Now, while his lifeless body was still suspended upon
the cross, the work was not yet complete until the Roman
soldier approached and plunged his spear into his
side, and thus Baptized the world in a fountain of Blood.
And, through faith in him, that is the only fountain that
can wash our guilty stains away, and present us purified
before his Throne.</p>

<p>Mark you the circumstances as they then transpired.
The sun was veiled, and "darkness prevailed
over all the earth, from the sixth until the ninth hour,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and it was at the ninth hour he cried, "It is finished
and gave up the ghost." It was his mission "to bring
life and immortality to light." God, the Father, had
veiled the sun, that the earth should be in utter darkness.
May it not have been the first act of His son's
immortality&mdash;after this tragic scene&mdash;to unveil the sun,
and throw its light&mdash;under a new dispensation&mdash;upon
the world? But he had come to conquer "death, hell,
and the grave," "and lead captivity captive." His body
was placed in a sepulchre; from whence he had said
he would rise on the third day. The Priests and Pharisees
remembering this, besought Pilate, who commanded
that the sepulchre be made secure, which was
done by a great stone under seal, and a guard stationed
over it, that no one might approach by day or by night.
But, behold, on the morning of the third day, an "angel
of the Lord appeared from heaven," whose descent
caused a great earthquake, who "rolled back the stone
and sat upon it; and his countenance was like lightning,
and his raiment white as snow; and for fear of him the
keepers did shake and became as dead men." The
angel said unto the two Marys, "I know ye seek Jesus,
which was crucified; He is not here, for he is risen."</p>

<p>Thus, behold his triumph! He burst the bands of
death asunder, and rushing forth from the tyrant's
grasp, shouted in triumph over this last enemy, "Oh,
death where is thy sting? Oh, grave where is thy victory?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
"I am the resurrection and the life." "I am
he that liveth and was dead, and behold I am alive
forevermore, and have the keys of hell and of death."
Thus the fulfilment of prophesy and the promise, that
he should become the first fruits of them that slept.</p>

<p>We have subsequent evidence of his resurrection,
where he appeared in the midst of his disciples, when
they had met in their private chamber and had closed
the door. But there have been doubters, and unbelievers,
in all ages&mdash;even though confirmative evidences
have been strong and plain. So, also, was there one in
that little assembly. Poor Thomas could not believe,
even though his Lord and Master stood before him; but
the Saviour, full of tender compassion, said to him:
"Come, place thy fingers in the nail prints, and thrust
thy hand into the opening made by the soldier's spear
in my side, and be not faithless, but believing."</p>

<p>Now while God through his prophet hath said,
"There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth him understanding," revelation is replete
with evidence that "though a man die, yet shall
he live again." Christ, the Son of God, illustrated his
power in uttering the command, "Lazarus, come forth,"
and he that had been dead four days, whose mortality
was fast decomposing and yielding to corruption, arose
again into life. Thus in the days of his incarnation, he
manifested his power by the miracles he wrought in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
numerous instances of restoring sight to the blind,
causing the deaf to hear; the dumb to speak; the lame
to walk; healing the sick; cleansing the leprous, and
bringing the dead to life again: while, in the power of
his own resurrection, he made triumphantly manifest
the immortality of the soul; and the entire New Testament
scriptures abound with evidences that through
Him "life and immortality have been brought to light."
Thus we see that the immortality of the soul, and a
future state of existence are plainly manifest.</p>

<h2><i>POSSIBILITY OF A MORE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE
OF GOD; OUR RELATIONS TO HIM,&mdash;AND
OF A FUTURE STATE OR PLACE OF
HABITATION.</i></h2>


<p>We believe that God himself has furnished us
evidences through which we should gain a
more intimate knowledge of him; of our relations
to him, and of our future state and place of habitation.</p>

<p>In sustaining this belief, and the hypothesis we
have already advanced, as to the location of heaven,&mdash;to
which we shall also add our views as to the location
of <i>hell</i>,&mdash;we shall rely mainly upon the revelations of
God, as found recorded in the Bible. Should we not
furnish positive, we believe we <i>shall</i> furnish strong
<i>circumstancial</i>, evidence which will as forcibly impress
the minds of our readers with the correctness of our
theory, as it has our own, upon the investigation
of it. With this we shall grasp, and intermingle, the
evidences afforded by the science of astronomy; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
mighty revelations of the wondrous works of God as
now revealed to us by the aid of the <i>telescope</i>.</p>

<p>We know that some of the most learned theologians
and ablest divines, of the past, as also many of the
present age, have written, and have labored hard&mdash;theoretically&mdash;to
point out to the mind's eye the locality of
heaven, fixed somewhere in illimitable space. But, as
yet, their most profound efforts, aided though they might
have been by the lights afforded through the science of
astronomy; the Bible, and all nature around them as
assistants to their own brilliant imaginations, have failed
to satisfy, even themselves, and all has resolved itself
back again into doubt and uncertainty, leaving the
minds of all bewildered with ideas as numerous, yet as
vague and uncertain as mystery itself. And yet we believe
we have within, and all around us, evidences
which, if properly considered and comprehended, may
shed true light upon the subject, and give to us ideas
and faith more reasonable and tangible than any heretofore
contemplated.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE CREATION.</i></h2>

<p>Let us now make some investigations of the
evidences given us in the Bible in regard to
creation. No one ever has, no finite mind
ever can fully comprehend the creative power of the
Almighty; nor can we form an idea of the time, in the
remote past, when creation, "by the word of His power"
commenced.</p>

<p>We learn from Bible history, that "In the beginning
God created the Heavens and the Earth." Now
as to the time when that "beginning" was, we can form
no positive idea. It is as reasonable to suppose it to
have been untold millions of years ago, as at any later
period. So far as this earth on which we dwell is concerned,
it is but as an <i>atom</i> when compared to the productions
of His creative power; and of the time when
this atom was created, no one knoweth. Geologists,
tracing effects back to causes, agree on the fair probability
that the earth&mdash;this globe and its solid elements&mdash;have
been in process of change and formation, many
thousands, and possibly millions, of years. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
students understand, in a great measure, the laws which
govern and control such formation in nature, and have
data for their conclusions. As for the time when God
created man to dwell on this earth, we need not now
stop to investigate.</p>

<p>But, continuing this history, we read:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness
was upon the face of the great deep. And the Spirit of
God moved upon the face of the waters; and God said, Let
there be light; and there was light."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we see that the <i>Spirit</i> of God was then, as it
ever has been, and still is, the <i>source</i> of light. Now, to
our finite comprehension, the Sun is the source of light
and heat; or, rather that which we denominate the Sun
is a vast body or volume of intense heat, and heat&mdash;or
that which we denominates <i>fire</i>&mdash;is, to us, the source
of light. That God's spirit is fire, and light, we shall
be able to show in our further contemplation of the
subject</p>

<p>The Psalmist tells us that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and
all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth."</p></blockquote>

<p>Job tells us that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"A flame goeth out of his mouth and God by his spirit
garnished the heavens."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Now let us bear these facts in mind: that the
Psalmist speaks of a plurality of heavens made by the
word and breath of God, while Job also tells us of a
plurality of heavens, and that "a flame goeth out of
his mouth," and "God by his Spirit garnished the
heavens."</p>

<p>We know that God is the Great First Cause, and
the Creator of all things that exist. He created the
Heavens and the Earth, Suns, Moons, Planets, and
Stars, and all pertaining thereunto; as, also, the firmament
of the heavens, in which all are placed; and
while all come forth at His command, or by His word,
yet we are plainly told, that His breath, or Spirit, was
the active agency in this mighty creation.</p>

<p>When we come to investigate the nature of this active
agency&mdash;Spirit&mdash;we find that it is <i>fire</i>, a principle,
or element which pervades all nature; one which is indestructible&mdash;can
never be destroyed&mdash;and yet an element
of destruction; indeed, one of seeming annihilation.
Now, seeing that the element of fire pervades all
things, so also are we told, that God's Spirit is everywhere.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE SUN&mdash;THE SOURCE OF LIGHT AND HEAT.</i></h2>


<p>First, acknowledging God&mdash;the Supreme, Infinite,
and Eternal One&mdash;as the Great First
Cause, and Author of all things created, we
all know that the Sun is the mainspring of animated
Nature. Without its genial rays, the present system of
Earth's government could not endure, and life itself
would soon disappear from our globe. It is the source
of light and heat&mdash;the two great stimulants of vital
force.</p>

<p>Now, so far as we can comprehend, the <i>Sun</i> is the
immediate or direct source of light and heat&mdash;or fire&mdash;hence,
the source of animated existence of all pertaining
to this Earth; and so, also, as we believe, to all the
other planets, or worlds belonging to our solar system,
or within the Sun's vast domain. That source is fixed
and permanent, and is ever the same; neither increasing
nor diminishing, although constantly dispensing its
influence to all around it.</p>

<p>Its source is eternal, and it is, evidently, an attribute
of Jehovah, and the time of its past existence we
cannot comprehend, nor can we believe otherwise than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that it will continue to exist through all eternity. We
believe it one of God's eternal lamps, placed by His
own Omnipotent power to light up the sphere which
He has appointed unto it, and to give its warmth and
animation to this, and all other worlds belonging to its
domain. Cast your eye upward at noon-day, when no
clouds intervene, and behold that brilliant orb, whose
light pales that of all else, and seems to make all dark
in illimitable space beyond its own empire. Look at it
but for one second of time only, for a steady gaze at
that bright flame for one minute alone, is fatal to the
sight of the eyes.</p>

<p>There <i>is</i> "a dimning veil" to mortal vision, which
hides the glories of that <i>inner world</i> from our sight;
even those resplendent glories which, while yet in the
body, we can contemplate only by the eye of faith.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>WONDROUS WORKS OF GOD.</i></h2>


<p>We now propose to devote a short time to the
contemplation of some of the wonderful works
of the Creator, as we see them displayed in
the firmament, and standing out in illimitable space,
and, with the aids afforded us by that most exact of all
sciences&mdash;astronomy&mdash;we hope to unveil mysteries,
long since revealed by the revelations of God; yet,
hitherto, not fully comprehended. These seeming mysteries,
we shall endeavor to assist you to analyze by the
light of God's own revelations. In order to our purpose,
we shall avail ourselves of the writings of some
of the most scientific, and eminent astronomers the
world has ever known, even from the early days of
Anaximander and Pythagoras, down to the times of
Copernicus and Galileo, when feeble rays of light seemed
to break in upon the intellect and mind of man, and
from thence, the flood-lights which have been thrown
in upon us by the Herschels,&mdash;the leading stars of the
empire of this science,&mdash;and calling to our aid La Lande,
Maury, Guillemin, Lardner, Darwin, Owen and Olmsted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and many others equally known to fame. Yet in
our present effort, we shall rely mainly upon that master
mind in compilation, Dr. Child, of England, who has
grouped together the leading facts of discoveries, in
order to incite the mind to the contemplation of the
wonderful works of the Creator, that all intelligences of
the world may be induced to join in with the three Hebrew
Children, in "praising and magnifying the name
of the Lord." We find, upon examination of the works
of various leading authors, that his statements are as
nearly correct as any compilation well could be, while,
with a mind seemingly inspired for the work, his delineations
are so graphic, sublime and beautiful, we shall
take data, and quote freely from his writings, especially
wherein he dwells upon the "Heavens," "Sun," "Moon"
and "Stars," adding as we pass along, such reflections
crowding upon our mind as we deem appropriate;
and we think that in the contemplation of the subject
now before us, that ere we have finished this feature
of it, all will be ready to exclaim with the Psalmist,
truly,</p>

<blockquote><p>"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament
sheweth his handy work."</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Child says, "Among all the sights the eye can
look upon, nothing is comparable to the Heavens for
the sentiment with which they charm the mind. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
language they speak comes to us from remote mysterious
worlds; but, though it may be imperfectly understood,
it is at least universally felt. The great and the
small&mdash;the civilized man and the savage, the philosopher,
the divine, and the illiterate or humble citizen&mdash;all
feel their influence, and are from time to time irresistibly
drawn toward them by mingled emotions of admiration,
gratitude and awe, such as none of the other
features of nature can excite in an equal degree.</p>

<p>"So strongly, however, is the idea of the 'incomprehensible'
associated by many with the mysteries of the
firmament, that they are habitually prone to regard the
teachings of astronomers as little else than scientific
guess-work. Nevertheless, the best intellects in all
countries assure us, and demonstrate before our eyes,
that, within certain limits, Astronomy is the most exact
and perfect of sciences, and that, even when it deals
with distances and magnitudes, which are practically
inconceivable, its conclusions, though often claiming
to be approximative only, have yet no affinity whatever
with guess-work. Let such sceptics think of the certainty
with which sidereal events are predicted beforehand.
Let them reflect on the evidence of the most
exact knowledge of the heavenly bodies involved in the
calculation of eclipses, in fixing the very moment when
the moon's dark outline shall begin to creep over the
sun's bright disk; marking its progress to the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
maximum, and its waning&mdash;giving the moment when
the last visible shadow will disappear&mdash;predicting the
instant when a planet's light shall be extinguished behind
our satellite. And yet even more wonderful, the
tracking of a comet's wanderings, millions of miles beyond
the far-off regions of Uranus, the foretelling the
time of its return after long years of absence! Do not
these, and a thousand other equally wonderful feats,
attest both the soundness of the principles on which the
astronomer works, and the reasonableness of receiving
his assurances with confidence and trust, even though
it may be impossible for more than a few gifted minds
to follow the calculations on which they are based?"</p>

<p>Examine the Nautical Almanac, published by the
British Government, a chart found on every sea-going
vessel. On the trackless ocean it is the mariner's guide,
his trusted friend and counsellor. He may embark upon
a long voyage over the trackless ocean, to be absent
for years, yet through all this time, and in any part of
the world he has his truthful friend to consult, who will
warn him of dangers, and direct his ship in safety in
every changeful clime. He left his native land years
ago, yet now far out amid ocean's waves, in a different
hemisphere, he consults this little chart of astronomers.
He knows in any and every latitude the time of eclipses
of the Sun and Moon, and of Jupiter's satellites, their
sidereal positions, distances, etc. It seems charged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
with messages from the skies for his guidance and
safety.</p>

<p>"When we consider the acquisition of such rare
and precious knowledge&mdash;this mapping out beforehand,
almost to a hair's-breadth, the exact order and track in
which the heavenly bodies will run their course through
space, and the precise relative position they will occupy
at any given moment, when they can be seen in any
part of the world&mdash;is not this convincing evidence of
the correctness and truthfulness of the science of
astronomy?"</p>

<p>But we have on record a more startling demonstration
of its correctness&mdash;we say "startling" because of
its magnitude and importance, and because when we
come to examine suns, planets, and worlds, through the
lights of this science, when we contemplate their distances,
magnitudes, and numbers, we shall be startled
by their immensity, and exclaim:</p>

<blockquote><p>"How wonderful are Thy works, O Lord of Hosts!"</p></blockquote>

<p>"The year 1846 will ever be memorable for having
witnessed one of the most striking illustrations of the
truth of Astronomy. Few can have forgotten the astonishment
with which the discovery of the planet Neptune
was then received, or the fact that it was due <i>not</i> to a
lucky or accidental pointing of the telescope toward a
particular quarter of the heavens, but to positive calculations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
worked out in the closet; thus proving that
before the planet was seen by the eye, it had already
been grasped by the mind. The theory of its finding
was a triumph of human intellect. The distant Uranus&mdash;a
planet hitherto orderly and correct&mdash;begins to show
unusual movements in its orbit. It is, somehow, not
exactly in the spot where, according to the best calculations,
it ought to have been, and the whole astronomical
world is thrown into perplexity. Two mathematicians,
as yet but little known to fame, living far apart
in different countries, and acting independently of each
other, concentrate the force of their penetrating intellects
to find out the cause. The most obvious way of
accounting for the event, was to have inferred that some
error in previous computations had occurred; and in a
matter so difficult, so abstruse, and so far off, what
could have been more probable or more pardonable?
But these astronomers knew that the laws of gravity
were fixed and sure, and that figures truly based on
them could not deceive. By profound calculations, each
arrives at the conclusion that nothing can account for
the "perturbation" except the disturbing influence of
some hitherto unknown mass of matter, exerting its
attraction in a certain quarter of the Heavens. So
implicit, so undoubting is the faith of the French
astronomer Leverrier, in the truth of his deductions,
that he requests a brother astronomer in Berlin, Prussia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to look out for this mass at a special point in space,
on a particular night; and there, sure enough, the disturber
immediately discloses himself, and soon shows
his title to be admitted into the steady and orderly rank
of his fellow-planets. The coincidence of the two
astronomers&mdash;Leverrier, of France, and Adams, of
England, arriving at this discovery through scientific
calculations, based upon knowledge derived from physical
observation, precludes every idea of guess-work,
while such was the agreement between their final deductions,
that the point of the Heavens fixed upon by both
as the spot where the disturber lay, was almost identical."
"Such a discovery" says Arago, "is one of the
most brilliant manifestations of the exactitude of the
system of modern astronomy."</p>

<p>Child continues: "Astronomy is without question,
the grandest of sciences. It deals with masses, distances,
and velocities, which in their immensity belong
specially to itself alone, and of which the mere conception
transcends the utmost stretch of our finite faculties.
In no other branch of science is the limited grasp
of our intellect more forcibly brought home to us, yet,
though baffled in the effort to rise to the level of its
requirements, our strivings are by no means profitless.
Is it not truly a precious privilege to be able to trace,
imperfect though it may be, the hand of the Almighty
Architect in these, His grandest works, and to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
by this means a broader consciousness of His Omnipotence?</p>

<p>Could each one be privileged to look through
Herschel's telescope on a clear night, and visibly behold
the wonders of the Heavens, our faith in the realities
of astronomy would pass with a sudden bound
from theory into practice; planets and stars would become
henceforth distinct and solid existences in our
minds, our doubts vanish, and our belief settle into
conviction. We should behold the mysterious moon
of our childhood, mapped into brilliant mountain-peaks,
and dark precipices, and softly lighted plains;
we should see Jupiter shining like another fair Luna,
with attendant satellites moving round him in their
well-known paths; or turn with admiration to Saturn
encircled by his famous ring, with outlines as distinct
as if that glorious creation lay but a few miles distant.
Perhaps we may behold the beauteous Venus shining
with resplendent circular disk, or curiously passing
through her many phases in mimic rivalry of the Moon.
Or, leaving these near neighbors far behind, we may
penetrate more deeply into space, and mark how the
bright flashing stars are reduced to a small, round, unmagnifiable
point. Such a privilege would give us a
more realizing sense of the power of the great Creator."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE DISCOVERY OF THE MOTION OF THE
EARTH AND HEAVENLY BODIES</i>.</h2>


<p>The science of Astronomy is one of the oldest
that has occupied the human mind. That the
belief in Astrology was its forerunner, we cannot
doubt. Professor Olmsted tells us, that, "At a
period of very remote antiquity, Astronomy was cultivated
in China, India, Chaldea, and Egypt." Three
several schools were established, ranging from three to
six hundred years before the Christian era. Anaximander,
in the school of Miletus, taught the sublime
doctrine that the planets are inhabited, and that the
stars are suns of other systems. Pythagoras was the
founder of the celebrated school of Crotona, upon
the south-eastern coast of Italy, some five hundred
years before the Christian era. He held that the Sun
was the centre of the solar system, around which all
the planets revolve, and that the stars are so many
suns, each the centre of a system like our own. He
also held that the Earth revolves daily on its axis, and
yearly around the sun. Although many of his opinions
were founded in mere conjecture, and were erroneous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
yet we see that some important ones were founded
on truth.</p>

<p>He also held that the planets were inhabited, that
the earth and planets were ever revolving in regular
order, "keeping up a loud and grand celestial concert,
inaudible to man, but, as the 'music of the spheres,'
audible to the Gods."</p>

<p>But the mind of man was not then prepared to
grasp the feeble rays of light, and add thereto, by the
power of expanding intellect. Although many succeeded
Pythagoras, whose scientific attainments proved a
blessing to the world, and whose names will go down
to all succeeding generations, as the learned, the good,
and the great of their time; yet prejudice and superstition
again prevailed, and the true lights of this science
were lost sight of, and, for near two thousand
years, ages of darkness prevailed, until Copernicus appeared
about the fifteenth century of the Christian era.
He again revived the idea advanced by Pythagoras,
that the earth and planets moved regularly in their
orbits, and that the sun was the centre of the solar system.
Yet with him, as with the former, it was little
more than mere conjecture.</p>

<p>We quote again Prof. Olmsted, in regard to these
earlier astronomers, who were struggling after light,
and truth, in this grandest of sciences: "Although,
therefore, Pythagoras fathomed the profound doctrine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
that the Sun is the centre around which the earth and
all the planets revolve; yet we have no evidence that
he ever solved the irregular motions of the planets, in
conformity with his hypothesis, although the explanation
of the diurnal revolution of the heavens, by that
hypothesis, involved no difficulty."</p>

<p>Again he says, "Ignorant as Copernicus was of the
principle of gravitation, and of most of the laws of motion,
he could go but little way in following out the
consequences of his own hypothesis; and all that can
be claimed for him is, that he solved, by means of it,
most of the common phenomena of the celestial motions.
He was indeed upon the road to truth, and
advanced some way in its sure path; but he was able
to adduce but few independent proofs, to show that it
was truth. It was only near the close of his life that
he published his system to the world, and that only at
the urgent request of friends; anticipating, perhaps,
the opposition of a bigoted priesthood, whose fury was
afterwards poured upon the head of Galileo, for maintaining
the same doctrines."</p>

<p>The bigotry and superstition of the priesthood of
the Church of Rome again crushed out the lights of
this science, and forbade further investigations, and all
was resolved back again into the doctrine first taught
by Eudoxus, who lived more than three hundred years
before Christ. This doctrine was the system of <i>crystalline
spheres</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> "the earth the centre of the world, and
all heavenly bodies set like gems in hollow, solid orbs,
composed of crystal so transparent, that no anterior
orb could obstruct in the least, the view of any of the
orbs lying behind it," that the heavens revolved or rolled
round from East to West, performing the circuit
every twenty-four hours, carrying along the sun, planets,
orbs, &amp;c., and that "above the whole were spread
the <i>grand empyrean</i>, or 'third heavens,' the abode of
perpetual serenity."</p>

<p>"To account for the planetary motions, it was supposed
that the planetary bodies, as also the stars, and
sun, each had a motion of its own from East to West,
while all partook of the common diurnal motion of the
starry sphere."</p>

<p>"Aristotle taught that these motions were effected
by a tutelary genius of each planet, residing in it, and
directing its motions, even as the mind of man directs
his own movements."</p>

<p>Thus, from the time of Copernicus, until Galileo
appeared in the sixteenth century, the lights of this
science were again extinguished by the superstition, bigotry,
and intolerance of the priesthood, who would
make no proper advance with intellect beyond the established
dogmas of the church; even to ascertain
truths which God himself had made plainly perceptible
in His wondrous works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>Galileo, born in Pisa, Italy, in the year 1564, evinced
in early life, a fondness for the study of philosophy, and
the higher order of sciences, and proved himself also
a genius in mechanical inventions. Fortune favored
him in his day, and, enjoying all the greater advantages
of the best schools of his time, he studied well all the
old masters, who had preceded him, and became perfectly
familiar with every theory of philosophy and astronomy
then known, and prepared himself for an
advance in the sciences. He invented the first telescope,
with which to survey the heavenly bodies, and the
result of his experiments proved conclusively the correctness
of the theory advanced by the conjectures of
Copernicus.</p>

<p>He pursued his investigations for years, and established
the truth, in his own mind, of the constant movements
of the earth and planets, each revolving in its
own orbit, with the Sun as the common centre of all;
of the truth of which he could never more entertain a
single doubt. But the laws which governed and controlled
their movements&mdash;the power and force of attraction
and gravitation&mdash;he could not yet fully comprehend.
This great work of discovery was left for Sir
Isaac Newton. Knowing the bigotry and intolerance
of the ruling powers of Rome, he, Galileo, resorted to
subterfuge in order to obtain permission to publish his
opinions to the world. Yet, when published, these drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
down upon his head the stern persecution of the Pope
and Cardinals, and also opposition and accusations from
all other philosophers and astronomers of his time. At
length, hearing the distant muttering "thunders of the
Vatican," he resorted to Rome, to reason with the
powers that then held universal sway. But, like all
other lights of reason&mdash;from time immemorial to the
present hour&mdash;the fiat of the Romish Church would
ever obscure, or crush out light, chain down the intellect,
become the arbiter of the consciences of men, and
permit no advance, save as she might lead; and even
then binding all to her dogmas, and decrees, by the
power of force, and threatenings of her Inquisitions. She
has ever stood ready, where she had the power, to crush
with her iron heel every one who dared to oppose, or
sought to lead the mind of man to light and liberty.
And it has been the force of circumstances alone, that
has, in part, broken this chain of bondage, emancipated
the mind, given freedom to thought, and permitted the
advance of human intellect.</p>

<p>Galileo seemed, indeed, as Nature's philosopher of
his time. "He interrogated the laws of nature by experiments
and observations, and we have to ascribe to
him the first true investigation of the laws of terrestrial
gravity." Had he stood firm and maintained the truths
which God had permitted him to comprehend, the lights
of a true science would then have shone forth, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
possible that our knowledge to-day would be far in advance
of what it is. We judge thus, because of the
rapid advance made during the last century, especially
since Dr. William Herschel first pointed his telescope
toward the heavens.</p>

<p>But on Galileo's arrival at Rome, neither his venerable
age, his enlightened mind, his acknowledged
comprehensive and brilliant intellect, nor even his honorable
and eloquent appeals for a full and scientific
investigation as to the correctness of his theory, could
gain a generous response. The powers that ruled had
not made the advance, and it was dangerous to them
to permit any one outside to do so. Hence, all new
doctrines were held as heretical, and must be crushed
at once. He was placed in confinement, charged with
treason and conspiracy against the Church; his views
heretical, such as demanded the most rigorous punishment;&mdash;even
after he should renounce them before the
cardinals sitting as Inquisitors in his case. The charges
against him were those of his published views, which he
freely acknowledged, and, while he knew them to be
<i>truths</i>, yet so controlling was the influence of his belief
in the dogmas of that church&mdash;even as it is with all its
adherents&mdash;that he bowed to its fiat, and, on bended
knees laid his hand upon the Holy Gospels, and swore
by them and the Roman Catholic Church, before God,
and the Inquisition of Cardinals, that the <i>truths he had
published</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> were <i>false</i>, abjuring, cursing, and detesting
them as heresies; and swore a life allegiance to the
Church, and received submissively, his sentence to a
dungeon in the Inquisition for life.</p>

<p>Says Prof. Olmsted, "We cannot approve of his
employing artifice in the promulgation of truth; and
we are compelled to lament that his lofty spirit bowed
in the final conflict. How far, therefore, he sinks below
the dignity of a Christian martyr!"</p>

<p>Says Dr. Brewster, "At the age of seventy, on his
bended knees, and with his right hand resting on the
Holy Evangelists, did this patriarch of science avow
his present and past belief in the Romish Church;
abandon as false and heretical the doctrine of the
earth's motion, and of the sun's immobility, and pledge
himself to denounce to the Inquisition, any other person
who was even suspected of like heresy. He abjured,
cursed, and detested, those eternal and immutable
truths which the Almighty had permitted him to be the
first to establish. Had Galileo but added the courage
of a martyr, to the wisdom of the sage; had he carried
the glance of his indignant eye round the circle of his
Judges; had he lifted his hands to heaven, and called
the living God to witness the truth and immutability of
his opinions; the bigotry of his enemies would have
been disarmed, and science would have enjoyed a
memorable triumph."</p>

<h2>THE ROMISH CHURCH.</h2>


<p>It is impossible for the mind to contemplate the
scene presented to the world, by the history of that
trial and unjust condemnation, without a shudder, if not
a premonition of what may yet be in the future.</p>

<p>Religious bigotry is more intolerant than any other
power of dominion, and where the mind and conscience
is trammelled, and brought under the subjection of superior
intellect, the masses become almost as menials,
ready to do their masters' bidding. We hold to a system
of religion, one which leaves the mind untrammelled,
and permits free intercourse with the spirit of God; that
which casts aside all that might obstruct or intervene,
and which enables the soul to commune with its Maker
and Redeemer; that which enables each "to know for
himself and not another." This is the Protestant faith
and doctrine, contra-distinguished from the Roman
Catholic faith, whose Popes, Bishops, and Priests, become,
as it were, the arbiters of the minds and consciences
of their adherents; stand between them and
their Maker, and trifle with the souls of men, as implements
and matters of commerce. It is time that the
days of superstition were ended.</p>

<p>It is fast losing ground in the old world, where, for
long centuries past, it has held the masses in ignorance.
But, of late years, it has been rapidly gaining ground on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
our own continent, and its progress of late has been
fearful, and may well alarm the Protestants of our own
country. We hold that Catholicism is little else than a
complete system of superstition. The minds of the
masses of its votaries are trained and educated to it
from childhood. Hence, there is no possibility of ever
eradicating it from the minds of those thus educated.
The priests, cardinals, and Pope, can, at any moment,
trammel free thought by their own edicts, and bring
their subjects to their own terms. Their subjects are
taught to believe them to possess superior power; to
be able to stand between them and heaven, or hell,
to lock, or unlock at pleasure; and so ingenious is their
system of religion taught, that it ensnares the mind and
holds it ever subservient.</p>

<p>We have seen with what submission that mighty
man of learning and towering intellect, Galileo, bowed
to this imperial power. By arduous study, labor and
experiments, he had gained a knowledge of his Creators
wonderful works, far transcending all that was known of
it by the ruling powers of Rome. He knew this knowledge
was truth, as immutable as God himself, yet, if
<i>cursed</i> by the Pope of Rome, he, doubtless, believed
this curse would place him in perdition, and no one
would pray his soul out of purgatory. Therefore, he
perjured himself (for when he had sworn it false, he still
believed it true) in order to reconcile the rulers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
secure their intercession. This is only an isolated case
out of, doubtless, thousands of others, where mind and
conscience is brought fully under their subjection.</p>

<p>Rome to-day, and the Romish Church, is the same
in spirit and ambition of universal sway, as in the days
of Galileo. Give her but the power, and rather than
lose it again, she would bind humanity in chains of perpetual
ignorance as to the source and lights of eternal
truth, save that which she alone might graciously promulgate;
and this to a favored few, whose trainings
were such that their consciences were securely chained
to her car, more ponderous and destructive, than that
of Juggernaut.</p>

<p>Some, perhaps, are ready to say we have borne
down too severely upon the Roman Catholics, that they,
too, are now more enlightened, and more liberal in
their views than formerly, that they have founded
schools and institutions of learning, equal&mdash;perhaps
superior, to those of any other denomination in our
country. Grant all this; but why, and for what purpose?
<i>Answer.</i> The force of circumstances; the enlightenment
of the age has compelled them to move
forward. They are ever wily and on the alert; the
philosophy of science was marching onward; the millions
could no longer be held in the old beaten track
of ignorance to pander to the few, and Rome, comprehending
all this, foresees her impending downfall, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
she, too, steps forward with her <i>gilded robe</i>. She
therefore, takes a new tack, with her ponderous ship,
upon the sea of mind. She has in store her mines of
wealth, gathered daily from the poor sons and daughters
of toil, some of whom almost starve themselves in
order to pay penance to the Priests for sins laid to their
charge, committed&mdash;if sins they be, in ignorance.
These priests&mdash;some of whom are besotted&mdash;still stand
forth as the arbiters of the consciences of their deluded
followers; pretend to bar the gates of heaven; admitting
none, save for the <i>shillings</i> or the <i>pounds</i>, showing
plainly that the continued organization of this church,
in this enlightened age, is but the force of early education.</p>

<p>Yes, they have erected their school and college edifices,
and also their <i>convents</i> and <i>monasteries</i>. They
have ample material for efficient teachers: but mark
you, these have all been well trained from infancy in
the "<i>lap of the Church</i>." They are obedient, efficient
and orderly, and, at proper times, are ready to make
advantageous displays. They take charge of all the
youth of <i>their</i> flock, and, alas, by their seductive insinuations,
are now making rapid progress against Protestantism
in our own country. They are educating tens
of thousands of Protestant youth.</p>

<p>Do they ever exhibit to, or instruct them in your
Protestant Bible? No, never! but on the other hand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
are they not constantly trying to instruct, charm, and
fascinate them with their own system of religious worship?
They are partial to your children&mdash;especially to
your <i>daughters</i>, who will, in time, be among the mothers
of the succeeding generation, and who, of course,
will train up their offspring in the same faith. Just let
them secure a majority of mothers as firm believers in
the Romish faith, and they will bid defiance to all opposing
influences. How long since one of their Archbishops
said, in a public address, in one of our leading
cities: <i>Let us once control the children, the youth of the
land, and we can soon control the nation</i>; or words of
this import? See their indefatigable exertions; their
complete system of organization; their primary schools,
their Seminaries, Academies, Colleges, Convents, and
Monasteries, already established, and to which they
are adding, annually, many more, while Protestants
seem to be slumbering over the kindling fires of a volcano,
which may in time break forth in all its destructive
fury, as it oft-times has during past centuries.</p>

<p>Is it not high time that Protestants of our own
country, were waking up in regard to their present, and
eternal interests? Let a preponderance of power be
centered in any one man, and you may then bid a final
adieu to a republican form of government, and must,
perhaps, bow to infamous and oppressive "decrees"
emanating from an iron will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>In our own country, this cannot yet be, unless the
usurper is backed by a soldiery, who are hired, and paid,
out of a controlled treasury. This could not long
maintain, in this, or any country, where there is freedom
of mind and thought, and where conscience remains
untrammelled. But let the masses be thus controlled
by one superior intellect, and feel that their
<small>ETERNAL</small> interests are subject to his will, and they will
be ever ready to do his bidding.</p>

<p>The Popes of Rome have&mdash;successively&mdash;held this
power over a portion of Europe, even as the history of
the dark days of the "Inquisitions" and martyrdoms
attest. Thus it has been, and thus we believe it ever
will be, where Roman Catholics gain universal sway:
for we believe there is scarcely a member of that organization
living to-day, who would not&mdash;at the Pope's
command&mdash;make every desired sacrifice; not only of
worldly goods and interests, but even of life itself&mdash;if
required.</p>

<p>We do not condemn&mdash;collectively, nor individually,
the masses, and members of that faith. Far be this
from us. We believe that a very large majority of them
are honest, and truly devotional. No other class of
people on the globe have been more self-sacrificing
than many of them, in performing acts of kindness,
charity and mercy, and these offices have been performed
in a true spirit of Christian benevolence. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that all other professed Christian organizations would
equal them in this respect. All should render relief,
when within their power, to suffering humanity. We
believe that all such efforts upon the part of any one,
will merit, and obtain, individual reward. What we
condemn is the spirit of the ruling powers of the Romish
Church; its bigotry, and intolerance; and because they&mdash;by
educating into their system of religion&mdash;trammel
the mind, and control the conscience, rendering them
subservient to the dictation and will of the rulers.
The Pope, bishops, and priests, claim to be the mediums
through which their adherents are saved, as,
also we believe mediums, whose "curses" pronounced
against any, will consign the soul to perdition, while
they chain the mind to superstition.</p>

<p>The Bible teaches that Christ is our only mediator,
that all may come to God through faith in His Son;
every soul is held alike responsible, and is alike accountable
to its Creator. That life and salvation are
freely offered alike to all, the requirement being, to
forsake the ways of sin, and through faith in Jesus
Christ, "return unto the Lord who will have mercy,
and to our God who will abundantly pardon."</p>

<p>It will be perceived that our principal objections to
that sect are their superstitions, bigotry, arrogance and
intolerance; the chaining down the mind, and controlling
the conscience, and using all for temporal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sway. The antecedents of this power are sufficient
to warn all Protestants against its encroachments, and
stimulate them to say, "Thus far shalt thou go and no
farther," and in order to this, let every Protestant denomination
see to the educating of their own children.</p>

<p>"But," say some of our Protestant mothers, "they
have the best schools, and I want my daughters to be
well educated, and accomplished; and I do not fear
their making Catholics of them." So, likewise, have
said thousands of others, and yet, trying the experiment,
they have been mistaken. Their daughters have
returned home fascinated with show and tinsel, and
firm adherents to that doctrine, which, when educated
into the mind, can never thence be eradicated.</p>

<p>Few are aware of the rapid advance the Catholics
are making against Protestantism, at the present
time. It is safe to say, that not less than from fifteen
to twenty thousand daughters, belonging to Protestant
families, are baptized into that church annually, in the
United States. On the other hand, few, if any, Catholics
ever become Protestants; and nine out of every
ten who do, will&mdash;if sick and fearing the approach of
death, send for Catholic Priests; make confession, and
implore their intercession, to rescue their souls from
purgatory, where they feel sure of going for this great
sin of apostasy.</p>

<p>Now we ask, how long will it take, with so large and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ever increasing accessions of our Protestant daughters,
for that organization to gain the ascendancy in our
country? Their motto is <i>eternal vigilance</i>, while they
wage eternal warfare <i>against the Protestant faith, and
Christian religion</i>. The time was, when they held
almost universal sway throughout a large portion
of Europe. The edicts of the Pope, and Roman
Catholic rulers, must be obeyed by <i>all</i>. Curses, torture,
imprisonment, and <i>death</i>&mdash;where they had the
power&mdash;was the portion of all who disregarded their
mandates. And then, as now, their hatred and persecutions
were against those whom they termed "<i>heretical
Protestants</i>;" against your ancestors, and your religion.
Kings, and Emperors, trembled on their thrones, and
lent willing obedience, lest a "Bull" should be issued
against them from the "Vatican" by the ruling Pope.
Those were dark days for poor Protestants; they had
to worship God in <i>secret</i>, or in dens and caves. Even
only a few centuries ago, terror and darkness reigned;
multiplied thousands were slaughtered, or dragged to
the "stake" and consumed by fiery faggots; grey hairs,
age or decrepitude, were no shields against their bigoted
fury. The priests then, as now, controlled and directed
the consciences of their followers. No compassion,
could be shown&mdash;even to purity and innocence of
defenceless females, or helpless children. Those who
could manage to escape and flee the country, did so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
leaving all of worldly goods and possessions behind
them <i>confiscated to the Church</i>, and, as strangers, poor
and friendless, sought, as best they could, asylums in
other lands&mdash;some of whom, finally reached our own
continent, here to enjoy liberty and the freedom of conscience.
And we have to lament the fact that many
of them, still tinctured with the rule and form of despotism,
had, by the force of previous circumstances,
imbibed notions akin to despotism and persecution,
and were, for a time, while they had the power, disposed
to use it as manifested by the Puritans first landing on
our shores. But they could not hold this power, because
of lack of a complete organization of a hierarchal power.
Free thought and free speech, and the liberty of
a free untrammeled <i>conscience</i> prevailed, and soon swept
away every vestige of religious intolerance and despotism,
and our North American continent soon towered
in sublime grandeur and beauty, and became the home
and asylum of freedom for the oppressed of every clime.
This land is the birthright of Protestants, wherein
those of every religious faith, Catholics, and all others,
have equal rights and privileges; but to maintain our
liberties, we must educate into the minds of all, <i>personal
liberty, and accountability</i>, and leave the conscience
untrammeled so far as regards popes, priests, bishops,
or ministers, <i>controlling man's future destiny</i>. All are
held individually, and personally, accountable to God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and He hath sent His Spirit to enlighten every one,
and all who go direct to Him in the spirit of humility,
with faith and prayer, will obtain this light.</p>

<p>In regard to the workings of the ruling powers of
the Roman Catholic Church less than two centuries
ago, we give place to the following recent developments,
written as a matter of history, by one who assisted
in the investigations only a few weeks ago. This
is from "Catholic Spain:"</p>




<p class="center">
<big>GHASTLY REVELATION!</big><br />
<br />
MORE RELICS OF THE SPANISH INQUISITION UNEARTHED.<br />
</p>

<p>The London <i>Star</i> has the following from Madrid:</p>


<blockquote><p>A somewhat ghastly incident has caused considerable
excitement here within the last few weeks. Within a few
hundred yards of the new Plaza de Dos Mayo, inaugurated
on the 2d of this month, there is a locality called the Cruz
del Quemadero. It is a field some three hundred metres
square, at the top of the Calle Aricha de San Bernardo,
near the hospital built by the ex-Queen. Through it a new
road was lately opened, and as the ground was elevated, a
cutting of considerable depth had to be dug. The workmen
laid bare several peculiar looking horizontal strata, of irregular
formation. One was one hundred and fifty feet in
length, another fifty, another ten. The thickness varied
from eight to eighty centimetres. In color the soil was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
black, the lower strata being much blacker than the superior
ones.</p>

<p>On examination lumps of charred wood were found, interspersed
with ashes, evidently the remains of some huge
fire. Curiosity was soon excited, and further investigation
demonstrated that in portions of these ugly-looking strata,
the finger came upon small pieces of adipose matter, which
yielded, like butter, to the touch. Iron rings were grubbed
up; human bones, a cranium, a long tuft of hair, having
belonged to some female. All these were more or less
charred. Some of the iron was partially fused, and the
texture of bone intermingled with sand was plainly discernible.
<i>A gag turned up.</i> The question, what were these
lugubrious records was answered at once. This field of the
Cruz del Quemadero was the place where the "<i>Inquisition</i>"
disposed of some of its victims. Here were the ghastly
proofs of the horrors of which this place had been the scene,
suddenly brought to light after the lapse of two centuries.
On the 12th of May, 1689, eighty-three heretics, including
twenty Hebrews, of whom five were women, were immolated
on this very spot. The pile of wood was eighty feet
in length by seven feet in height. A great concourse witnessed
the <i>auto da fe</i>, and the horrible ceremonial completed,
the people buried the remains of their victims under
cart-loads of earth. These irregular geological strata are
naught else but the silent testimony to the atrocities perpetrated
on this in the name of religion and "Catholic Unity."
Out of one, your special correspondent hooked out with his
finger, one entire bone of a human vertebral column, a portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of the tibia, a fragment of a shoulder-blade with a hole
through it, and a bit of a rib, all bearing the marks of fire.
Upward of two cart-loads of remains of this sort have been
carried away and decently buried. But these horrible
strata! There they remain to tell their own tale, and instruct
the present generation. On the 13th, a public meeting
was convened, to be held at the Quemadero, by the
Republican youth of Madrid, to protest against priestly
intolerance and to advocate <i>freedom of conscience</i>. That
this discovery should have been made at a moment when
the Spanish clergy are striving their utmost to affirm the
"unity of the Roman Catholic Church," and are preaching
in the churches of the metropolis against heresy, is a striking
coincidence.</p>

<p>The Quemadero is so frequented by people in search of
relics, and the explorations of these strata have been so
extensive, that the authorities have barred the frontage off,
and prohibited access. It is their intention to cut a square
block, and there erect a monument. It is estimated by
Llorente, the great historian of the Inquisition, that this
atrocious tribunal has deprived Spain of twelve millions of
souls, including the Jews, and Moors, expelled from the
country. Thirty-one thousand and ninety-two perished by
fire; 17,659 were first butchered and then burned; 221,985
died of torture. Total, 270,736.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rome, ever intolerant in spirit, her persecutions
have ever been the same through all ages, and in all
countries, where she had the power of physical force.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
And thus, we believe, it would be to-day, on this
continent, had she now the ascendency here. Daily,
in private, are you denounced by their priests, and
minions, as heretics, while it would seem that no
bishop, or priest, of that church, can ascend a rostrum
in any of their cathedrals, without venting his spleen
in outspoken or implied anathemas against all Protestants.</p>

<p>Your daughters, under their special care in their
schools and academies, are taught by the Lady Superiors,
and sisters&mdash;by insinuations, if not directly&mdash;to
believe theirs the only true church of God on earth.
They are told by their confidential associates, that all
who do not believe their faith, and in the Roman Catholic
Church, are held by them as "<i>heretics</i>" and, without
this belief, need never hope to get to heaven.
Their governesses and teachers are ever wary, at
first, of manifesting, or of exercising a direct influence,
as regards controlling their religious belief, and will tell
you, when you are about to place your daughters under
their care, that they never teach the children of Protestants
the Catholic religion, and yet, by their machinations,
adopt the most efficient means of accomplishing
it. They are sure to gain their <i>confidence</i>, and, very
soon, with nine out of ten, they have more of this than
even the mother enjoys. When they have gained this,
confidence, their task becomes an easy one, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
know well how to perform it. On each recurring Sabbath,
all who are under their care must attend church,
and they are accompanied by the superiors or teachers,
to <i>their</i> church, and there must sit and hear the religion
and faith of their own parents denounced in the boldest
terms. They are young and inexperienced; their minds
susceptible of impressions, and these they receive and
nurture with such effect, that long before the period
arrives for them to leave the "Institution," the faith
and doctrines of the "Church of Rome" are firmly
ingrafted in their minds; and they return home fully
resolved to be (even if they have not already been)
confirmed by the ordinance of Baptism in that church.
Thus, their religious belief is educated into their minds,
and no parental influence can ever change their views.</p>

<p>"But," say some, "we send our children to their day-school,
and hence, have them under home influence
most of the time, and in this way there is no danger."
Let us examine and see whether there is, or is not.</p>

<p>This mode of procedure is one of their organized
systems for induction into your "good graces," so that
they may eventually accomplish their ends. By this
seeming open-heartedness, they allay all suspicion, and
overcome any prejudices you may have cherished
against their system of religion. They are all working
for the future ascendency of their church. It must not
be a matter of haste; the minds of Protestants, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
are yet in the ascendency, are not prepared to yield all
in open conflict. Hence, they must be patient; must
work and wait. Such a course, on their part, will disarm
you of even suspicion, and cause you to think and
speak well of them. This is always their first step.
Soon they will open the doors of their academies to
admit your daughters, where they <small>MUST</small> remain during
all the term&mdash;save a short "home visit" now and then,
from which they must return on the day, and even the
very hour stated by the "Superior." Have you ever
noticed how <i>promptly</i> your daughter has felt it her duty
to obey this command, and return to that school? Was
it ever thus while she was attending a Protestant
school? Think you she would be so mindful of <i>your</i>
request; so <i>anxious</i> to leave pleasant society; unwilling
to remain even an hour longer, and return to you
and loved ones at home? Nay, I tell you she would
not do it under ordinary circumstances. See now who
already holds the confidence of, and greater influence
over your child!</p>

<p>But see on yonder eminence a Convent, a Monastery,
a Nunnery, with its towering dome, and surrounded
by massive walls. There, perhaps, is the place
wherein your young and beautiful daughter will be immured
to spend a weary life in <i>crucifying</i> herself, and
doing penance daily for imaginary sins she has never
committed. Thus, shutting herself up within that living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
tomb from all the outside world, and the happiness
to be enjoyed in social life; she is as dead to you, and
to the world, as though in her coffin, and in her grave;
while the mind is as obscured as to the true lights and
freedom of eternal truth and salvation, as though reason
were dethroned, and she a maniac. This condition
has been brought about by influences brought to bear
upon her mind, commencing with your daughter's first
entrance into their primary schools. Confessions must
soon be made to the priest, and, by his arts, he soon
gains the ascendency over, and becomes the arbiter of
the mind and conscience, and more especially is this
influence exerted to this end, if the child is an <i>orphan</i>,
and is the rightful inheritor of a valuable estate. For
it would seem that to this end do the ruling powers of
that sect devote time, energy, and influence&mdash;as witnessed
by so many young females, whose parents left
them fortunes, surrendering all to the church, and
taking up a life abode in their convents.</p>

<p>We do not condemn the poor deluded victims, nor
believe they are held accountable in their delusion.
They are honest in their devotions, yet perform these
under false delusions. And when their spirits are released
from this double prison-house, and return to
God who gave them, they will then realize the freedom
of the Spirit of God, and how abundantly it giveth
<i>light</i>, <i>life</i> and <i>liberty</i>. And they will then also realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
their salvation is alone of God&mdash;through his boundless
mercy; and not in anywise through intercession of the
<i>Priest</i>.</p>

<p>We warn you to look well to passing events. History
so oft repeats itself, that we can but believe there
is danger. Remember that when Luther&mdash;the bold
pioneer of Protestantism&mdash;stood forth the champion of
Christianity, to his followers there came, from this
same source, persecutions, martyrdoms, and massacres&mdash;even
a reign of terror and darkness upon Europe.
But it proved a darkness that preceded a dawn; and
although seemingly, at the time, dreadful in its consequences,
yet none can deny but that the world is far
better because of his efforts, than to have slumbered
on in ignorance and in sin. From this same cause,
our own continent may be destined to pass through a
period like that of the "dark ages." If so, we trust in
God it may come forth from it cleansed and purified;
even as the current of the "lost river," that loses itself
in the bosom of the "Blue Ridge," where, with a wild
whirl, its turbid waters dash into the resounding cavern,
but on the other side reappear, clear, placid, and
beautiful.</p>

<p>We say to all Protestants, remember, that in
placing your children under the care and influence of
Catholic teachers, and Priests of that Church, you lend
your aid to obscuring their minds, and, in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to your own belief, shutting out from the eye of faith
God's own eternal truth. They go to men as "intercessors"
instead of to Christ the Lord&mdash;the Son of
God, who redeemed them with His own precious blood&mdash;who
alone can intercede for them. And you also
aid in re-establishing universal sway to the ever-intolerant
Romish Church. The time may come when&mdash;driven
from the Old World&mdash;her central power will be
on this continent: and, erecting here her gorgeous
temples from the estates you leave to your children,
the Pope will ascend the throne of the American Vatican&mdash;under
and around which will be the dark dungeons
of the Inquisition&mdash;and thence thunder forth his
"<i>Bulls</i>" and <i>Anathemas</i> against the feeble followers
of the blessed Redeemer. That Church is by far the
most intolerant of all the professed Christian organizations
on this globe. Their members are not even
allowed the privilege of attending religious worship
anywhere else than under their own instructions, and
we opine, that should any one of them do so without
"dispensation," they are held as having committed a
sin, for which they must soon repair to the Priest,
make confession, do penance, receive absolution from
him, and pay the price.</p>

<p>Behold the avarice of this "whore of Babylon!"
Not content with tribute paid to her&mdash;perhaps weekly&mdash;through
a long lifetime by her deluded followers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
when nature yields to the fiat of the Eternal One, mortality
drops to moulder into dust, and the spirit returns
to God who gave it, so completely are the minds of all
her adherents under the control of the Priests, that
they can still lay <i>penance</i> upon the dead, and demand
and obtain <i>tribute</i> from the living offspring.</p>

<p>In closing our remarks upon this subject, we submit,
for the reflection of all Protestant ministers and
members in every quarter of the world, the following,
a portion of the Pope's address to the English clergymen,
who presented him an address signed by some
eighteen hundred clergy, April 20th, 1869. After
examining the document closely, following other remarks,
he said:</p>

<p>"In the mean time, we must cultivate in a most
special manner the <i>spirit of unity</i>, for in that lies our
strength, and its want is the weakness of our adversaries.
I have noticed the Protestants are perpetually
appealing to the primitive Church; but when I turn to
the early ages of history, what do I see? Unity! all
the more reasonable because existing undoubtedly in a
different state of society from the present. The Apostles
were all of one accord, and one mind. * * * *
Protestants, on the other hand, are disunited; and our
strength, in the difficulties we have to encounter, lies in
<i>perfect union</i>. * * * It will be the old story over
again. There will be waves and storms and threatenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
on all sides, but we shall be brought safely
through * * * while our <i>adversaries</i> are struggling
with the waves."</p>

<p>Let all ponder well these remarks. The philosophy
that "in union there is strength" is a true one. And
if all Protestants cannot unite as one great body and
family&mdash;because of minor non-essentials in matters of
faith, forms and ceremonies&mdash;let all unite in the one
great essential, that all their children, and orphan
children of Protestants, shall be educated in other
than Catholic schools. For, in these latter, we hold
that the mind is chained to error and superstition, and
the true lights of God's truth and plan of salvation are
obscured. Every parent and guardian will be held
accountable in a coming day, should they neglect to
"train up their children in the way they should go."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Our readers will please pardon us for the digression
we have made from the special subject we have under
consideration. Had we not been duly impressed with
the importance and correctness of our views upon the
subject of the freedom and liberty of mind and conscience,
and of the personal accountability of <i>all</i> to
God alone, we should not have thus pursued the theme.
We believe firmly in the good <i>offices</i> of a teaching and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
advising ministry, but not in anywise where it <i>trammels
the mind or becomes the arbiter of the conscience</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Returning to our subject, <i>viz.</i>, the earlier discoveries
of the science of Astronomy. The intelligence of
the world is indebted to Sir Isaac Newton, who lived
during the latter part of the sixteenth century, for the
discovery of the laws of <i>universal gravitation</i>. His
discovery, and philosophy, furnished the basis upon
which all subsequent astronomers have worked.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>ATTRACTION, GRAVITATION, &amp;c.</i></h2>


<p>The power of attraction and force of gravitation
are the laws which govern the universe of
matter. "The discovery of this law," says
Prof. Olmsted, "made us acquainted with the hidden
forces that move the great machinery of the universe.
It furnished the key which unlocks the inner temple of
Nature, and established the science of Astronomy upon
a sure and firm basis. Thus we discover in Nature a
tendency of every portion of matter toward some other.
This tendency is called gravitation. The larger the
body, the more powerful the attraction; and this
attraction is always toward the centre. Hence, you
may cast an object of weight into the air, and, when
the impelling force you have given it ceases to force it
upward, it falls in a direct line to the earth." So also
may the Chinaman, placed on the opposite side of the
globe, cast one as he deems upward, which is forcing
it in an opposite direction from where you sent yours;
yet, when his impelling force is lost, his too falls back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to the earth, each falling toward the other. This is
gravitation, produced by the power of attraction. Thus
we now see this principle made plain to the simplest
comprehension.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>SUNS, STARS, PLANETS, &amp;c.</i></h2>


<p>We come, now, to the contemplation of that which
is of far greater importance to us than all other
planets, worlds, stars, and wonders in the siderial
Heavens. This is the Sun, which warms and lights
up our earth, and all the other planets within its sphere.</p>

<p>Says Dr. Child, "There are not a few in this world
who habitually receive God's blessings so much as a
matter of course, that they are scarcely conscious of
any active feeling of gratitude in regard to them. The
very regularity and profusion with which these blessings
are showered on all alike, seem to have the effect of
deadening the sense of individual obligation. A general
admission of thankfulness may occasionally be
made at church or in the closet, but there is a want of
that abiding consciousness of it, with which we ought
to be imbued, as well as that frequent pondering upon
details which, by illustrating the dependence of every
creature upon God, causes the heart to swell with
grateful adoration. Such thoughts never fail to improve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
our moral nature by bringing the truth home to
us more and more that we are God's children.</p>

<p>"It would be no easy task for a thankful mind to
sum up all the blessings diffused over our planet by the
Sun. It is the mainspring of animated Nature.
Without its genial rays the present system of Earth's
government could not endure, and life itself would soon
disappear from the globe. To it we are indebted for
light and warmth&mdash;the two stimulants of vital force&mdash;for
our food and raiment; for our busy days and rest-bringing
nights, for months and years, and happy alternations
of seasons. Its rays, in short, are intertwined
with all our wants and comforts; they gladden the eye
and cheer the heart. Contemplating all these temporal
blessings, the <i>Psalmist</i> exclaims:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>I will praise the name of the Lord with a song, and
magnify it with thanksgiving.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>"The Sun is the central pivot of the solar system,
and round it the earth and all the other planets keep
whirling in elliptical orbits. Its power and influence,
its light, heat, and attraction, reach through a domain
in space which it would require <i>six thousand millions of
miles</i> to span. With the greater part of this wide field,
astronomers are familiar, and it may be truly said that
scarcely a man knows the roads of his own parish or
neighborhood, or a citizen the streets of his own city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
or village, with more exactness than they do the highways
of the skies. Not only can they map out to a
nicety the paths of the planets careering through it like
islands floating through a sea of ether, but they can
look backward and tell the exact spot where each globe
was at any moment of the remote past, or forward, and
point to the place where each will be found at any
given moment of the remote future.</p>

<p>"What is the mighty power which maintains such
order in the Heavens, which steadies the planets in
their orbits, and traces out for them a route so wisely
planned as to avoid all chances of collision? Two
antagonistic forces&mdash;gravitation and attraction, combined
with a centrifugal impulse&mdash;accomplish the wonderful
task. To these faithful servants, God commits
the safety of the Universe, nor can anything disturb or
derange the order of this machinery, save the Word
which created it.</p>

<p>"The Sun was placed in the centre, and became
the pivot of the whole system, tying to itself the different
planets by the cord of its superior attraction. In
accordance with the law we have mentioned, this loadstone
power of the Sun is the inevitable result of its
superior mass, as it is computed to be six hundred
times greater in magnitude than this earth and all the
planets put together." But behold the wisdom and
wondrous power of the Great Architect, in creating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
these vast worlds, and placing each in its proper position
in space; where each revolves within its own orbit&mdash;some
with the velocity of even one hundred thousand
miles an hour&mdash;yet maintaining toward each other that
<i>centrifugal</i> force which prevents their being drawn by
the attractive power of that vast globe <i>within</i> the Sun,
into certain destruction, by its surrounding fires.</p>

<p>"Astronomers inform us there are innumerable
Suns, each of which is supposed to control a separate,
or its own system of planets; giving light and heat
thereto, even as our Sun does to this Earth, and its
own system of planets. Their distances from the Sun
that lights up our Heavens are immeasureable&mdash;far
transcending our conceptions, or even our imagination&mdash;in
illimitable space. They also inform us that the
distance from this Earth, to the nearest one of these
distant stars, or suns, is about <i>twenty billions of miles</i>."
So vast is the distance here stated, that the mind cannot
grasp or comprehend it. We can more nearly approximate
by the measurement of light; a ray of which darting
from its surface and travelling at the speed of 192,000
miles a second, would not reach our eye under
three years and eight months. "Such then," says Sir
John Herschel, "is the length of the sounding-line with
which we first touch bottom in the attempt to fathom
the great abyss of the sidereal heavens." Says Olmsted,
"Until recently, astronomers gave almost exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
attention to observations, and the study of the solar
system. But Dr. William Herschel turned his attention
to the sidereal heavens, and opened up new and
wonderful fields of discovery, as well as of speculation.
His son, Sir John Herschel, and Sir James South, of
England, have followed the old master, with grasping
minds and brilliant intellects, until more has been accomplished
by them, and others of the present day,
than all preceding astronomers had even ventured to
conjecture," and that their deductions are founded
mainly on facts, no intelligent mind will&mdash;on investigation&mdash;have
reason to doubt.</p>

<p>But having thrown anchor and "touched bottom"
in the wide expanse of the unlimited sphere of the
sidereal heavens, "let us," says Dr. Child, "take another
flight. Here next, within the domain of Sirius,
we find ourselves six times as far distant as when at
Centauri, first mentioned"&mdash;say one hundred and
twenty billions of miles&mdash;"from which it would require
<i>twenty-two years</i> for a ray of light travelling at the rate
of 192,000 miles a second to reach our Earth." But, far
distant, yonder, we behold the beauteous <i>Capella</i>, in all
its splendor and glory, throwing its effulgent rays
across the wide expanse of universe, and yet these
rays of light, travelling at the same mentioned rate&mdash;192,000
miles each passing second of time&mdash;require
about <i>seventy years</i> in transit, before the inhabitants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
our Earth catch a glimpse of their brilliancy and
beauty. And yet now the mind has only entered the
borders of '<i>the starry regions</i>'&mdash;far beyond, in illimitable
space, lie the 'Hosts of the Stars;' their vast distances
cannot be computed even by light itself."</p>

<p>It is wonderful to contemplate the probability that
of some of the more distant stars discovered, the rays
of light which have found rest in the eye of the Astronomer,
through the aid of the telescope, may have left
their native sun thousands of years ago, and travelled
at the rate of 192,000 miles a second ever since. "A
certain cluster of stars was estimated by Sir William
Herschel to be 700 times the distance of a star of the
first magnitude&mdash;therefore at least 700 times nineteen
billions of miles!" But, observes Guillemin, if this
cluster was removed to five times its actual distance,
that is to say 3,500 times the distance of Sirius, the
large Herschelian telescope of 40 feet focus would still
show it, <i>but only as an irresolvable Nebula</i>. It is, then,
extremely probable that, among the many Nebulæ indecomposable
into stars, beyond the Milky Way, in the
depths of the heavens, many are as distant as that of
which we speak. <i>Doubtless many are more so.</i> Now
to reach us, light-rays must have left stars situated at
such a distance more than 700,000 years ago!" Says
Child, "When we have touched the verge of this uttermost
range, Infinity, boundless as ever, still lies beyond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
The idea of God extinguishes in our mind
every suspicion that there can be any limit to space,
magnitude, or power, in relation to His works. The
mighty universe we have been considering is but the
stepping-stone to what is farther on; and although our
imagination fails to grasp it, our reason assures us it
must be so. There is no such thing as taking from or
adding to <i>The Illimitable</i>.</p>

<p>"With what just propriety of thought has light been
called the 'voice' of the stars. * * * In the
'speechless' voice of light the stars proclaim to us from
the depths of space, the existence of innumerable other
worlds which, like our own, share the Creator's care.
* * * With mute argument stars prove to us that, in
those far-off regions, gravitation&mdash;the power that brings
the apple to the ground&mdash;still reigns supreme, and with
suggestive whispers of probability, they persuade us
that, like our own Sun, they bathe attendant worlds in
floods of light; deck them in colors of beauty, and
shower countless blessings on the life of myriads of
beings.</p>

<p>"Having glanced at the distances and magnitudes
of some of the stars, or suns, let us pause for a moment
to consider their number, and the vast space they
must necessarily occupy in the domain of Creation.
By the most moderate estimate the number of stars
that can be counted in the firmament by telescopic aid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
does not fall short of <i>one hundred millions</i>. There is
no doubt that most of those stars are <i>Suns</i>, dispensing
light and heat to earths and planets like our own; and,
indeed, no bodies shining by reflected light would be
visible at such enormous distances.</p>

<p>"From the superior magnitude of those that have
been measured&mdash;as compared to our Sun&mdash;it may be
assumed that the average diameter of their solar systems
must exceed our own; but taking them as nearly
equal, it would give a breadth of at least <i>six thousand
millions of miles</i> as the field of space occupied by each,
while every star, or sun-system, is probably begirt with
a gulf or void like that encircling our own, in which
the antagonistic forces of attraction are lost, so as not
to disturb each other. Hence, the distance from each
of those suns to its nearest neighbor is probably not
less than that which intervenes between our Sun and
the nearest star, which cannot be less than about <i>twenty</i>
billions of miles. How inconceivably vast, therefore,
must be the space required to give room for so many
and such stupendous solar systems. The mind absolutely
reels under the load of conceptions so mighty.
<i>Yet Infinity still lies beyond</i>."</p>

<p>"For what purpose," says Sir John Herschel, "are
we to suppose such magnificent bodies scattered
through the abyss of space? Surely not to illume our
nights, which an additional moon of the thousandth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
part of the size of our own would do much better; not
to sparkle as a pageant, void of meaning and reality,
and to bewilder us among vain conjectures. He must
have studied astronomy to little purpose, who can suppose
man to be the only object of his Creator's care, or
who does not see, in the vast and wonderful apparatus
around us, provisions for other races of animated beings."</p>

<p>The Psalmist says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whoso is wise will ponder these things, and they shall
understand the loving-kindness of the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us here suggest the reasonable hypothesis, that
those distant suns, standing far out in the sidereal regions
of illimitable space&mdash;created, and placed there
by the "Word" of the Almighty architect&mdash;may have
been shining thus for untold billions of years; and so,
also, the sun which shines upon and lights up and warms
this earth, and the other planets within its domain; and
will thus remain forever, as God's own lamps of eternal
light, to all created intelligences.</p>

<p>Hear the Psalmist break forth again,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Thy testimonies are wonderful. Who alone doeth great wonders.</p>

<p>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth His handy works.</p>

<p>Such knowledge is too wonderful for me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Job tells us,</p>

<blockquote><p>"He alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon
the waves of the sea, and doeth wonders without number."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><i>Fixed stars</i>&mdash;held by astronomers to be suns&mdash;are
known from the planetary stars by their perpetual
"twinkling," and by their being, apparently, always in
the same position relative to each other. Now, while
the number of stars to be seen in the heavens by the
naked eye on a clear night does not exceed about 3,000
in each,&mdash;the northern and southern hemispheres,&mdash;yet
Herschel, Olmsted, and other examiners tell us that by
the aid of the telescope, many millions stand out in
brilliant array&mdash;so vast their number that they cannot
be correctly computed, but are supposed to be at least
<i>one hundred millions</i>.</p>

<p>Prof. Olmsted declares it fully demonstrated that
"<i>the fixed stars are suns</i>," and, with other astronomers,
argues the fair probability of many of them being of
far greater magnitude than our own sun. Dr. Wollaston,
a distinguished English philosopher, attempted
to estimate the magnitude of certain of the fixed stars
from the light which they afforded. "By means of an
accurate <i>photometer</i> (an instrument for measuring the
relative intensities of light), he compares the light of
Sirius with that of the sun. He next computed how
far the sun must be removed from us in order to appear
no brighter than Sirius. He found it would require to
be <i>one hundred and forty-one thousand times</i> its present
distance, and even at that great distance Sirius must
give out twice as much light as the sun, or that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
point of splendor, Sirius must be at least equal to two
suns." "But," adds Prof. Olmsted, "as <i>Sirius</i> is more
than <i>two hundred thousand times</i> as far off as the sun,
he has rendered it probable that its light is equal to
that of <i>fourteen suns</i>." (We wish you to bear these
facts in mind, they will serve you when we come to
speak of the magnitude of our own sun.)</p>

<p>But let us follow Prof. Olmsted a little farther. He
says, "We have already seen that they are large bodies;
that they are immensely farther off than the farthest
planet; that they shine by their own light; in short,
that their appearance is, in all respects, the same as
the Sun would exhibit if removed to the region of the
stars. Hence, we infer that they are bodies of the
same kind with the Sun.</p>

<p>"We are justified, therefore, by a sound analogy, in
concluding that the stars referred to were made for the
same end as the Sun; namely, as the centres of attraction
to other planetary worlds, to which they severally
dispense light and heat. Although the starry
heavens present, in a clear night, a spectacle of unrivalled
grandeur and beauty, yet it must be admitted
that the chief purpose of the stars could not have been
to adorn the night, since by far the greater part of
them are ever invisible to the naked eye, nor as landmarks
to the navigator, for only a small proportion of
them are adapted to this purpose, nor, finally, to influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
this Earth by their attraction, since their distance
renders such an effect entirely insensible." Therefore,
arriving at the only rational conclusion <i>that they are
Suns</i>, many of them suns of vast magnitude; shining
with splendor and brilliancy equal to, or surpassing that
of our own Sun; each giving out light and heat to their
attendant planets and revolving worlds within their
own domain, or sphere,&mdash;"may we not ask, for what
purpose are these gifts dispensed to those surrounding
worlds, if not for the use of percipient beings?</p>

<p>"We are therefore led to the inevitable idea of
a plurality of worlds; and that they are inhabited
by some order of intelligences, and the conclusion
is forced upon our minds that the spot which the
Creator has assigned to us is but a humble province
in his boundless empire."</p>

<p>None, however, can form a correct estimate, or
comparison, between this, our diminutive Earth, and
those vast orbs&mdash;suns&mdash;fixed so remote from us in the
sidereal regions, nor of the numbers, until in some
measure they have familiarized their minds with, and
understand, to some extent, the science of astronomy,
and then survey the vast field through a suitable
telescope. "Even the first view through it, pointed
heavenward, will astonish and fill the mind with awe
and wonder; and as each new-grasping power is given
to the instrument; new fields of those regions are joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
on to those already explored, and every new stratum
of space thus added is found to be studded with stars
in ever increasing ratio; until myriads have come forth
from the dark depths of the firmament, and they have
a grand panoramic view of a Universe of Worlds peopling
the realms of boundless space." Then, in wonder
and amazement, they will more fully realize and
comprehend the Omnipotent power of God in the manifestations
of His creative word. Then, in comparison,
each realizing his own diminutiveness: that he is even
less than an unperceived infinitesimal atom floating
along in the gentle breeze, he will be led to exclaim
with the Psalmist:</p>

<blockquote><p>"How wonderful are thy works, O Lord of hosts!</p>

<p>What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of
man that thou takest knowledge of him?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Dismissing, for the present, the further contemplation
of those far-off millions of stars, or suns, and their
multiplied millions of attendant planets and worlds, we
come back to the contemplation of our own Sun, and
its attendant planets, things with which we are more
familiar, and which are&mdash;seemingly&mdash;more tangible.</p>

<p>As we have before remarked, the Sun governs and
controls our Earth, and the other planets and worlds
within its domain. Some of these worlds are not
greatly dissimilar to this in which we live; some are
smaller, while others are vastly larger&mdash;some computed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to be even a thousand times larger than this
Earth, and, as we believe, all are peopled with some
high order of intelligence.</p>

<p>Having gathered the foregoing facts from the most
undoubted authorities&mdash;astronomers, whose mathematical
and philosophical calculations have for their
base the immutable laws established by creative wisdom,
as now revealed in Nature, we shall still rely&mdash;more
or less&mdash;upon them for statistical facts and data,
in further expositions from which to make deductions
and draw our conclusions.</p>

<p>We are desirous of familiarizing your mind with the
mighty and wondrous works of God, so plainly manifested
in His creating and sustaining power, which
few, comparatively speaking, seem to comprehend in
any other way save in the daily temporal blessings of
life. Should our feeble efforts raise your thoughts
higher, and enable you to contemplate Him with the
eye of faith in the light of reason, and Divine revelation;
to know more of His greatness and power, and
your entire dependence upon Him for all temporal
blessings in life; for the <i>only</i> consolation you can have
in the dying hour, and as your only hope for the future,
and should such contemplation draw your mind and
heart to Him in holy love, and godly fear, we shall be
well rewarded for our efforts.</p>

<h2><i>FIXED STARS ARE SUNS.</i></h2>


<p>We now propose to dwell for a short time upon
the distance, magnitude, elements, and offices
of the Sun.</p>

<p>The Sun itself speaks to us with its voice of light,
and it is our high privilege to understand, and thus
comprehend mysteries long hidden, which are now
being revealed. Special manifestations were long
since made by Jehovah, which were left for those of
the present enlightened age to comprehend; when the
mind of man is more fully able to grasp His truths,
and look up through Nature to Nature's God.</p>

<p>Now fix your mind's eye upon that brilliant orb
of&mdash;seeming&mdash;eternal day; that Sun which is ever shining,
ah! whose light never pales, nor fails its vast
empire. No storm-clouds obscure its brightness in the
higher realm, neither is there waning of light, nor a
wasting of its substance. Possibly, from all eternity
of the past it has been, and through eternity to come it
will remain the same. We, on this Earth, have our
days and nights, our sun-shine and shadows, tempests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and storms. Our nights are the result of the daily
revolution of the Earth, these are when that portion of
it on which we dwell is turned away from the Sun, and
the shadow of the Earth&mdash;which is surrounded by a
dense atmosphere&mdash;is that which constitutes our darkness.
This atmosphere is a screen to us by day to
modify the intense heat of the Sun's rays. Otherwise,
it is possible that no animated life could exist. This
atmosphere has in it the elements of production, which&mdash;when
absorbed by the Earth&mdash;assists in bringing forth
for the sustenance of man and beast, and all living
things. Did not this atmosphere exist, our midnight
hours would be almost as bright as noonday. See in
this the wise provision of our heavenly Father.</p>

<p>That Sun is farther away, and of far greater magnitude,
than you now comprehend, or even imagine.
We will now state its dimensions, distance, elements,
&amp;c., as measured and determined by the science of astronomy,
and as agreed upon by all the best informed
and most profound mathematicians and astronomers
throughout the world.</p>

<p>The diameter of the Sun is <i>eight hundred and
fifty-five thousand miles</i>. It would require <i>one hundred
and seven worlds</i>, the size of this Earth, set
side by side to reach across it, and <i>one million four
hundred thousand Earths</i>, the size of this, to make a
globe of equal magnitude. It is <i>two millions six hundred
and fifty-five thousand miles round it</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> while its
bulk is not less than <i>six hundred times</i> as great as all
the worlds and planets it controls within its sphere put
together,&mdash;some of which, as we have told you, are estimated
to be a thousand times larger than this Earth.</p>

<p>Is your mind expanding? are your views enlarging,
so as to enable you to comprehend its vast dimensions?
Let the revelations of astronomy assist you.
Look at it again. From the comparatively small size
of its disk as we see it from the Earth, the distance
must be vast indeed to dwarf it down thus. The distance
is great, no less than about <i>ninety-five millions
of miles</i>. It is three hundred and eighty-five times as
far away as the Moon: it is estimated that a cannon
ball fired from this Earth and keeping up its velocity
at the rate of <i>five hundred miles an hour</i>, would not
reach it in less time than about twenty-two years. Still,
though these are well demonstrated facts, ascertained
by very correct measurement, by the most scientific
mathematical surveyors of the heavens, yet we desire
some more plain or familiar illustration. Let us investigate.
Here we have it; are you ready for a journey?
The celebrated Braley has calculated the time
required for a trip of ocular exploration. He observes,
"A railway train starting from this Earth, and running
continuously, at the rate of <i>thirty miles an hour</i>, would
arrive at the Moon in eleven months, but would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
reach the Sun in less time than about <i>three hundred
and fifty-two years</i>." We can partially comprehend
this by calculation (although the years of the oldest
individual of our country have not been sufficient to
take him more than one third of the journey, even had
he been placed on such train and started when an infant
at his mother's breast). Had the train been started
only nineteen years later than the discovery of North
America by Columbus, in 1498, and travelled thirty
miles each hour since, it would just now be approaching
the border of the Sun, and, on arriving there, if a
tunnel was opened and a track laid direct through it,
"this train, continued at the same speed, would require
more than a year and a half to reach the Sun's centre;
three years and a half to pass through it, and more
than ten years to pass round it.</p>

<p>"Now this same train would attain the centre of
this Earth in five days and a half; pass through it in
eleven days; and go round it in about thirty-five days."
Thus you see the diminutiveness of this Earth as compared
to the Sun. These calculations are founded on
facts so clearly demonstrated by the science of astronomy,
that but few who examine into it will question
their approximation to correctness.</p>

<p>Now while the mind is somewhat familiarized with
that vast globe, the Sun, let us contemplate it further.</p>

<p>Sir John Herschel, the most profound philosopher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
in the science of astronomy the world has ever known;
one whose inventions and improvements in the telescope
have far surpassed those of all others; one who
has enjoyed the highest advantages in the study and
demonstration of the science, and who has made most
important discoveries in regard to the sun, and moon,
and the planets&mdash;and even the fixed stars, or suns, in
the far off sidereal regions&mdash;tells us that from his investigations
and discoveries in regard to the Sun, there appears
to be <i>a vast globe within</i> the surrounding <i>photosphere
of fire</i>, shielded by a void or non-luminous
atmosphere, thus apparently protecting it from the
surrounding flame of fire, and rendering it possible
that the vast globe within is susceptible of animated
life, which may exist there in some form. This, with
the general corroboration of other astronomers, as to
the two encircling volumes of atmosphere&mdash;the outer a
luminous, and the inner a non-luminous one&mdash;is strong
evidence confirmative of our hypothesis of the existence
of that immense inner globe, or world, which is
doubtless in reality the <i>Heavenly world</i>; the Saviour's
empire, and the abode of the righteous.</p>

<p>Methinks, had Sir John Herschel but turned his
attention for awhile to the flood-lights of Divine Revelations,
made by God himself through His Spirit to
fallen man, he would ere this have opened the "gate"
to the eye of faith, and bid the weary Christian to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and behold the confines of that bright world which
was opened, and flashed its inner light upon the eyes
of the dying martyr Stephen, when,</p>

<blockquote><p>"Being full of the Holy Ghost, he looked up steadfastly
into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing
at the right hand of God, and said, Behold, I see heaven
opened."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, we are led to the inevitable conclusion that
heaven is not so far distant but that it can be seen from
earth by the <i>spirit-eye</i>, if God shall but open, and disclose
it to view. Where else can we imagine its location,
to be within range of&mdash;even immortal&mdash;vision from
this earth? St. John, while in the spirit, had a view
of that heavenly world, and the vast city with glittering
jasper walls, and gold-paved streets, and even the
"great white throne," the Saviour on that throne, surrounded
by an innumerable company that no man can
number.</p>

<p>St. Paul, in spirit, was caught up, even into the
"third heaven," and "saw and heard things which it
were not lawful for man to utter" to mortals on earth.
He tells us that "eye hath not seen, neither ear
hath heard, nor hath it entered the heart of man, the
glory that shall be revealed." But we will not here
anticipate the still stronger evidence we have yet to lay
before the mind as we pursue this interesting theme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>Bear in mind the fact that heaven is considered by
the most learned and ablest writers on theology, as "a
fixed place," permanent and abiding. That it is vast
in extent, and glorious in appearance, and has, within,
all the necessary elements and arrangements for complete
happiness. And, we believe, that not very
remotely distant from it is the place where is the element
of punishment for the wicked. We think the
revelations of God, and the manner and mode of his
manifestations to the children of men, together with
the revelations of astronomy in regard to the Sun; its
magnitude and elements, will, when we come to consider
them further, not only startle the mind, but prove
our hypothesis well-founded.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>A CONTEMPLATION.</i></h2>


<p>Just here, may we not, for a few moments,
speculate in mind upon a possibility, which,
as we advance, will assume more the form of a
probability?</p>

<p>Look once more upon that brilliant orb, whose
light, <i>without</i>, may be one of the lamps of eternal day.
Look but for one second of time only; for, as we have
told you, a steady gaze into its fiery flame of brightness
for one minute alone is fatal to the blinding of the unprotected
eye. May not <i>within</i> be the place of which
the poet's spiritual eye caught a glimpse, when alone in
silent meditation he penned those sublime and beautiful
lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"There, on those wide extended plains, shines one eternal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There God, the Son, forever reigns, and scatters night away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No chilling winds, nor poisonous breath, can reach that healthful shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sickness and sorrow, pain and death, are felt and feared no more."<br /></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>May not that be the <i>Heavenly world</i> wherein stands
the "City of God, whose foundations are eternal,"
and whose maker and builder is the great Architect of
the Universe? Its walls are Jasper, and are ever glittering
in the glory-light of eternal day. Its apartments
are gorgeously furnished in brilliant array. "<i>I go</i>"
said the Saviour, "<i>to prepare a place for you.</i>" There
"the gold-paved streets," there the "Great white
Throne" and "Christ the Lord" who sits thereon as
the judge and ruler of His own native Empire&mdash;for it
is He that shall judge the nations of this Earth, and
in the "great day" of "final judgment" he will recount,
in evidence, some of the scenes through which he
passed on this Earth, to justify his final and unalterable
decision.</p>

<p>May not there gush forth the crystal "fountains of
life" from which to drink will quench all thirst; and
there the "rivers of life" ever flowing, in whose waters
to bathe will renew eternal youth, and immortality, to
dwell on and on with eternity itself? May not Moses,
and Elijah, and the Prophets, and Martyrs be there?
May not many of us, who are still on this Earth, contemplate
the theme that there (in that bright world at
whose boundary surface we cannot, while dwelling in
mortality, gaze for even one minute of time without
being blinded) we have a father, a mother, sister,
brother, husband, wife, a child, or some loved friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
who have left the shores of Time, and are safe with their
blessed Saviour, to dwell in his sun-light throughout
"eternal day?"</p>

<p>May we not contemplate the possibility of these
things, when we remember that it is said of Heaven,
"the Righteous shall dwell <i>therein</i>," and that "God"
in His eternal manifestations "dwells in light unapproachable"
to us in our mortality, and is only manifest
to us here by His invisible <span class="smcap">Spirit veiled in fire</span>?</p>

<p>Startle not when we come to lay before you the well-defined
elements surrounding that vast globe. The
timid mind might naturally recoil, and stand aghast at
the thought of approaching such volume of intense
heat and "devouring flames." Remember that you
are still in the body, subject to all the pains and penalties
of fallen humanity. Remember that God has
created no element incompatible with his own nature;
remember that He is the Almighty power who hath
created all things, and in the infinity of His power,
can control any element for our happiness, and also the
same for our misery. Thus it will appear that "every
man's work shall be tried as by fire;" the righteous to
be saved as by fire, and yet the wicked to be destroyed
or tormented by fire. In this we can see the Infinity
of the power of God in the salvation and happiness of
His children&mdash;who are "the children of light," as also
in the torments of the "children of darkness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>But we shall be able to show that "God's Spirit <i>is
fire</i>" and that He <i>does</i> so control this element, or
change our nature, that whatever these may be, they
are properly adapted to constitute ineffable happiness
to the immortal state of the righteous. This, we trust,
will appear plain to you before you have finished the
perusal of these pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE SUN, AND GLOBE WITHIN.</i></h2>


<p>We now propose to continue our investigations
of the Sun; in considering its surrounding
elements, offices, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We have already said that it is the main-spring, and
we may add, barring the Great Author, the source
and fountain of animated Nature; the source of light
and heat, the two stimulants of vital force, without
which no animated life could exist on this earth; and
so, doubtless, with all the other planets and worlds
which it controls. And, while contemplating it thus
as the immediate source of unnumbered blessings to
the human race, and to all intelligences or animation
belonging to this, or other worlds within its domain, we
should not fail in devout reverence to the <i>great Author</i>,
who created all by the "Word of His Power"&mdash;not
only our Sun and its retinue of attendant planets, but
those innumerable, far distant ones of which we have
told you, with all <i>their</i> attendant trains, yea, even all
things, above, around, and beneath; the computation
of whose numbers, their magnitude, grandeur, and transcendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
glory so far exceeds our finite comprehension,
that we are lost in wonder and amazement, and can
but feel that, in comparison, we are less than an <i>atom</i>
of this vast and boundless Universe of Creation.</p>

<p>The Sun, represented as a "brilliant orb" a
"luminary" or "luminous body," has also been denominated
a "globe of fire." Some astronomers consider
it an "<i>incandescent</i> body" (<i>glowing whiteness of intense
heat</i>).</p>

<p>Dr. Herschel's views respecting the Sun are, that it
is a planetary body like our earth, diversified with
mountains and valleys, to which, on account of the
magnitude of the Sun, he assigns a prodigious extent&mdash;some
mountains six hundred miles high, and valleys
proportionately deep. He does not employ in his
explanations volcanic fires, as some others have done,
but supposes two separate regions of dense clouds
floating in the solar atmosphere at different distances
from the sun. The exterior stratum of clouds he considers
as the depository of the sun's light and heat,
while the interior stratum serves as an awning or screen
to the body of the sun itself, which thus becomes fitted
to sustain life-animation. This refutes the idea advanced
by that celebrated French Astronomer, La Lande, who
held "that the sun is a solid opaque body, having its
exterior diversified with high mountains and deep valleys,
and covered all over with a burning sea of liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
matter. The solar spots, he supposed, were produced
by the flux and reflux of the fiery sea, retreating occasionally
from the mountains, and exposing to view a
portion of the dark body of the sun."</p>

<p>But Prof. Olmsted (to whom we are indebted for
this and much other information on this subject), refutes
this hypothesis by showing the inconsistency that fluid,
of the nature here spoken of, or supposed to exist,
should depart so far from its equilibrium and remain so
long fixed, as to lay bare the immense space occupied
by the solar spots&mdash;some of which are supposed to be
fifty thousand miles in diameter.</p>

<p>Prof. Olmsted also examines the hypothesis of Dr.
Herschel, relative to clouds surrounding the sun, and
reasons as follows: "I am compelled to think the
hypothesis (of Dr. H.) is encumbered with very serious
objections. Clouds analogous to those of our atmosphere
(and Dr. H., expressly asserts that his lower
stratum of clouds are analogous to ours, and reasons
respecting the upper stratum according to the same
analogy) cannot exist in hot air; they are tenants only
of cold regions. How can they be supposed to exist in
the immediate vicinity of a fire so intense, that they are
even dissipated by it at the distance of ninety-five millions
of miles? Much less can they be supposed to be
the depositories of such devouring fire, when any thing
in the form of clouds floating in our atmosphere, is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
once scattered and dissolved by the accession of only
a few degrees of heat. Nothing, moreover, can be
imagined more unfavorable for radiating heat to such
a distance than the light, inconstant matter of which
clouds are composed, floating loosely in the solar
atmosphere."</p>

<p>Prof. Olmsted continues, "If we inquire whether
the surface of the Sun is in a state of actual combustion,
like burning fuel, or merely in a state of intense
ignition, like a stone heated to redness in a furnace,
we shall find it most reasonable to conclude that it is
in a state of ignition. If the body of the Sun were
composed of combustible matter and were actually on
fire, the material of the Sun would be continually wasting
away, while the products of combustion would fill
all the vast surrounding regions, and obscure the light
of the Sun. But solid bodies may attain a very intense
state of ignition, and glow with the most fervent
heat, while none of their material is consumed, and no
clouds or fumes rise to obscure their brightness, or to
impede their further emission of heat." Hence, for
these and other reasons, Prof. Olmsted thinks it more
probable that the heat is that of a high state of ignition,
rather than produced from combustion.</p>

<p>Thus we see that while all Astronomers agree that
the Sun is the source of light and heat; that this heat
is vastly intense; consuming, and yet never consumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
or exhausted, it is a difficult matter to determine the
nature and true element composing it. All agree however,
that God himself created it and placed it in its
proper position, and controls it for His own wise
purposes.</p>

<p>Most Astronomers consider it an incandescent body
(glowing whiteness of intense heat), encircled with two
atmospheres. That next its surface is supposed to be
nonluminous, while the outer one which floats upon it
is <i>luminous</i>&mdash;and forms a "<i>photosphere</i>," this is what
we see in looking at the Sun's bright disk. This photosphere
radiates the heat and light which vivify the
planets of the solar system, and imparts the stimulæ
of life and animation. It is said that flame-like masses&mdash;some
computed to be one hundred and fifty thousand
miles in length&mdash;are piled upon, and overlap each
other, and sweep onward in constant agitation like
mountain billows of living fire. Its brightness far transcends
and pales that of all other luminaries, and
would that of millions of stars as bright as Sirius, or
even hundreds of thousands of full moons.</p>

<p>We accept this view, as to the outer photosphere,
and believe this "<i>incandescent</i>," yet not a solid body,
but rather a <i>photospheric ethereal</i> element occupying its
appointed space, and that it has nothing to do whatever,
with the vast <i>inner globe</i> which is entirely shielded
from it by the intervening void, denominated by Astronomers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
as a surrounding nonluminous atmosphere.
Sir John Herschel tells us that his investigations led
him to the belief that this shields the globe within, and
thus renders it susceptible of maintaining life, or some
form of animated existence. Hence, we deem the evidences
afforded by astronomy, strong, if not fully conclusive
that our hypothesis is correct. But when we
add to this the evidences found in the Bible&mdash;God's
own revelations to man&mdash;we think there can scarcely
remain a doubt in the mind of any who follow us in
this investigation.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We now propose to consider more definitely the
nature of that volume of flame, or intense heat, which
we denominate the <i>Sun</i>. Of its temperature it is difficult
to form an estimate the least comprehensive. We
know our furnace heat will fuse cast-iron at a little less
than 3,000 degrees. Oxy-hydrogen flame&mdash;one of the
hottest known&mdash;is estimated at about 14,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, while the temperature ascribed to the Sun
is about 12,000,000. There is nothing our senses can
realize, or our minds conceive, that will enable us even
to approximate the intensity of this heat.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Now we have seen that the Sun is the source of all
light and heat; the source&mdash;when the element is concentrated&mdash;of
that which we denominate <i>fire</i>. The
phenomena that fire pervades, by some of its constituents,
every thing, and all space, is incomprehensible
otherwise than in the belief that the Spirit of God
is everywhere. Although fire is always on this Earth
in a concentrated form, yet its source is the Sun, and
from this source we can concentrate it into visible ignition.
And yet we see that the element itself is <i>ethereal</i>;
it will consume by combustion, yet its heat and
flame always tends upward, and disappears in its own
ethereal element, and we can recognize no solid substance
in it. We can feel and realize its warmth and
vivifying influence; we enjoy the light, as one of its
productions, yet all are <i>ethereal</i>, and we cannot grasp,
mould, or retain it. We know that the Sun&mdash;that volume
of heat&mdash;is the active source and agency of life
and animation, and it imparts its blessings to us in a
thousand ways; yet, misused, it proves the source and
element of punishment and destruction.</p>

<p>We have said that light and heat are the two great
stimulants of vital force. These two stimulants are
inseparably connected. Heat is the source of light,
and without heat <i>there would be no light</i>, for even reflected
light is derived from this source; this is manifest
to every intelligent mind. Therefore, we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
plainly that the Sun is the source and mainspring of
all animation, and to its influence, directed and controlled
by the Allwise Creator, are we indebted for
every blessing&mdash;nay, even life itself. It acts upon the
elements appointed unto it, and brings forth all animation.
It causes the earth to yield her productions;
clothes the forest with green, gives to the "rose" and
the "lily" their beautiful tints and fragrance, and imparts
to the flowers of garden and forest their thousand
variegated hues. It gives to man his strength and
wisdom, and to woman her beauty and loveliness, and&mdash;with
refined and cultivated intellect&mdash;her ten thousand
charms.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.</i></h2>


<p>Let us now turn our attention, for a short time,
to the contemplation of the planets, or worlds,
belonging to our own solar system; those
within the domain of our own Sun, and to which it
dispenses light and heat. With these, our Astronomers
are, so to speak, quite familiar. We cannot do better
than to present them to you in the language of Dr.
Child, whose writings have afforded us so much correct
data in preceding pages.</p>

<p>"In gazing at our fellow-planets on a clear night,
as we see them stand out with pre-eminent brightness
among the twinkling stars, who has not longed to penetrate
the mystery of their being, and to know whether
they, like our own Earth, are worlds full of life and
movement? The vast distance that intervenes between
us forbids us to expect a direct solution of the question,
for no instrument yet made, or that we can hope
to make, will bring their possible inhabitants within the
range of our vision. We are reduced, therefore, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
survey them with the sifting force of intellect, and to
rest contented with such circumstantial proof as is
derived from a knowledge of their general structure,
and the analogies subsisting between them and our
Earth.</p>

<p>"Among our nearest neighbors, <i>Venus</i> is nearly
the size of our Earth; and <i>Mercury</i> and <i>Mars</i>, though
considerably smaller, would still form worlds which, to
our ideas, would not in their magnitude be so very
different from our own. As before remarked, all the
planets revolve in elliptical orbits round the Sun, and
the time consumed in their journey constitutes their
year. Their polar axis is not 'straight up and down,'
but leans over or is inclined to the plane of their orbit,
so that each pole is turned toward the Sun at one period
of the year, and away from it at another. This
arrangement insures the regular alternation of seasons
and a variety of climates on their surface. The orbital
inclination of <i>Mars</i>, for example, is much the same as
that of the Earth, and, therefore, the relative proportion
of his seasons must have a close resemblance to
our own. It might be expected under these circumstances
that ice would accumulate toward the poles in
winter time, as on our Earth, and accordingly glacial
accumulations have not only been observed by
Astronomers, but it has been remarked that they occasionally
diminish by melting during the heats of summer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
while they increase in winter. Now as the planets,
like the Earth, turn round on their axis with perfect
regularity&mdash;and those just mentioned do so in very
similar periods of time, hence, all have their days
and nights.</p>

<p>"We have already stated that the Earth and its
fellow-planets are kept steadily in their orbits by the
exact adjustment of <i>centrifugal</i> and <i>centripetal</i> forces.
Hence each moves in its regular order.</p>

<p>"Now by way of comparison, Astronomers have
denominated the Sun as a globe two feet in diameter,
or six feet in circumference. Starting from this globe
let us wing our way across the space filled by the solar
system. A short flight of thirty-seven millions of miles
brings us to a world which, compared to the two-feet
globe, is no larger than a grain of mustard seed, while
it is so bathed in the Sun's dazzling rays that it is not
easily distinguished when viewed from the Earth. This
fussy little planet whirls round the Sun at the tremendous
pace of 100,000 miles an hour, by which he
proves his title to be called <i>Mercury</i>, the 'swift-footed,'
of mythology. At a distance of sixty-eight millions
of miles from the Sun we behold <i>Venus</i>, the brightest
and most dazzling of the heavenly hosts. In comparative
size she may be represented as a <i>pea</i>. She is our
nearest neighbor among the planets, and the conditions
under which she exists recall many of those under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
which we ourselves live. About ninety-five millions
of miles from the Sun we come upon another 'pea' a
trifle larger than the one representing <i>Venus</i>, and in
it we hail our own familiar Mother Earth. Here we shall
not now linger, but passing onward some fifty millions
of miles we are attracted by the well-known ruddy glow
of <i>Mars</i>&mdash;whose comparative size is that of a <i>pin's head</i>.
His mean orbital speed is 54,000 miles an hour&mdash;nearly
our own pace&mdash;but as he takes twice as much time
to run round the Sun as we do, his year is consequently
twice as long.</p>

<p>"Casting a glance behind, we are reminded of the
growing distance that now separates us from the sun by
the perceptible waning of his light.</p>

<p>"We next spread our wings for a very long flight.
In passing through the "asteroid" zone of solar space,
about 260 millions of miles from the sun, we may chance
to fall in with some worlds of smaller dimensions than
those we have been contemplating. We know very
little about them, except that their ways are eccentric
and mysterious. At length the shores of huge <i>Jupiter</i>
are reached at a distance of nearly 500 millions of miles
from the sun. To carry on the comparison, he is a
"small orange" to the "pea" of our earth, or to the
two feet globe that represents the sun. His orbit is a
path 3,000 millions of miles long, which he accomplishes
in an "annual" period of about 12 of our years. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sun's light has now shrunk considerably; but four brilliant
moons or satellites, one or more of which are
always "full," help to afford some compensation. But
let us "onward" in our "outward-bound" course. We
again pass through a space of nearly equal distance as
that of <i>Jupiter</i> from the sun. We are now more than
900 <i>millions</i> of miles distant from the central pivot.
Here we fall in with <i>Saturn</i>, whose comparative size
may be represented by an orange considerably smaller
than the last (bear in mind the comparative sizes, our
earth as a "<i>pea</i>" to these each an orange). His year
swallows up almost thirty of our own. And in this far
distant region the Sun, though giving only about one
ninetieth part of the light which we receive, is still equal
to 300 full moons, and is at least sufficient for vision,
and all the necessary purposes of life, while no fewer
than eight satellites supplement the waning sun-light, besides
a mysterious luminous "ring" of vast proportions.</p>

<p>"Twice as far away from the Sun as Saturn, <i>Uranus</i>,
represented by a <i>cherry</i>, plods his weary course. Although
his real diameter is 35,000 miles, his circumference
over 100,000, being more than four times the size
of our own earth, yet he is rarely seen by the naked eye.
His annual journey round the Sun is 10,000 millions of
miles, and he consumes what we should consider a lifetime,
84 <i>years</i>, in getting over it. Our little <i>earth</i> has
now faded out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>"Only a few years ago, <i>Uranus</i> was the last planetary
station of our system, but the discovery of Neptune
in 1846, gave us another resting-place on the long
journey into space. Here, at a distance of nearly 3,000
<i>millions</i> of miles from the Sun, we may pause awhile
before entering upon the more remote exploration of
the '<i>starry</i> universe.'</p>

<p>"We are approaching the frontier regions of our
system, and the Sun's light and the power of his attraction
are gradually passing away. Between the shores
of our Sun-system and the shores of the nearest star-system&mdash;they
also being suns&mdash;lies a vast, mysterious
chasm, in the recesses of which may still lurk some
undiscovered planets, but into which, so far as we yet
know, the wandering comets alone plunge deeply.</p>

<p>"We now stand on the frontier of the Sun's domain,
and are, in imagination, looking across one of those
broad gulfs which, like impassable ramparts fence off
the different systems of the universe from each other.
It seemed needful that the great Architect should interpose
some such barrier between the contending attractions
of the giant masses of matter scattered through
space; that there should be a <i>sea</i> of limitation in which
forces, whose action might disturb each other, should
die out and be extinguished. In it the flood-light of
our glorious Sun gets weaker and weaker, and its bright
disk wastes away by distance, until it shines only as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
twinkling star. And the strong chain of its attraction
which held with firm grasp the planets in their orbits,
after dwindling by fixed degrees into a force that would
not break a gossamer, is finally dissipated and lost.</p>

<p>"Now we ask, Is it likely that those vast orbs&mdash;with
masses and densities so wonderfully modified and
adjusted in accordance with what we perceive to be
the requirements of living creatures&mdash;with years and
months, days and nights, seasons and climates&mdash;with
atmosphere and twilights, trade-winds and currents&mdash;with
clouds and rains, continents and seas, mountains
and polar snows&mdash;with sun, moon, and stars, and, in
short, with all the elements that make up the conditions
of a habitable globe&mdash;is it likely that those glorious
works of the Creator should have been formed to
lie waste, sterile, and unprofitable? Or even if we
could bring ourselves to think that those masses,
whose united bulk dwarfs our Earth into insignificance,
had been solely created as make-weights to keep this
little atom of Earth in its place, why should they have
been provided with complicated systems of moons revolving
round them to give them auxiliary light? The
Sun's light they share in common with ourselves; but
for what conceivable purpose should deserts void of
life have been supplied with those wonderful lamps to
light them up in the absence of the Sun? Conditions
that might be incompatible with our organization, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
be by adjustment of creative wisdom exactly suited
to the beings placed to inhabit them. All life, even if
it be essentially the same in principle, may not everywhere
assume the same phase of outward existence,
nor need we attempt to set limits in this respect to the
Lord of Life. The spaces lie there furnished ready&mdash;the
Word was only required to people them with life.</p>

<p>"Such inquiries have an interest which goes beyond
their mere astronomical import, for they touch
our conceptions of God's greatness, wisdom, and power.
Is there one who does not long to be able reasonably
to cherish the thought that, far away from this
<i>tiny</i> speck of Earth, in the remote realms of space, we
behold worlds inhabited by beings who, it may be, are
privileged to know their Creator, and to bless, praise,
and magnify Him forever."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>We have seen that all leading Astronomers agree
in the fact of a "<i>plurality of suns</i>," and a
"<i>plurality of worlds</i>," and their numbers so
vast that they are beyond our computation. Now we
hold that in all this vast creation, there is a controlling
element, and that this element is necessarily manifest
in all things, and so predominates that percipient intelligences
should, and we believe can&mdash;to a certain
extent&mdash;comprehend it. Do you ask, what is this element?
we answer <i>fire</i>!</p>

<p>We have presented to your mind&mdash;as far as we are
able to comprehend&mdash;the Infinity of God's wisdom
and power, as manifested in his wonderful Creations;
not only in creating this Earth on which we live, and
all pertaining thereunto, but of Heavens, Suns, Planets
and Worlds, whose numbers are <i>millions</i>, as they are
seen standing out and peopling the realms of boundless
space, and yet we know that so vast is the infinity of
His wonderful creations, that we have given to the
mind only a bird's-eye view within the borders of His
boundless Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>We are aware that the idea we advance&mdash;that the
vast globe, encircled by the photosphoric, ethereal
flame (that which we denominate the Sun), <i>is our heaven</i>,
as also the heaven for intelligences of the other
planets of our solar system, and that there are numerous
other suns of similar import which may also be
heavens for created intelligences inhabiting their surrounding
planets&mdash;is new to the mind of man, and that
at first thought some may be incredulous; thus, as we
said in the beginning, it has ever been with all important
discoveries, and especially so of discoveries through
the lights and science of astronomy. Nevertheless, the
wondrous works of the Creator, as we have surveyed and
contemplated them&mdash;we think&mdash;will justify our hypothesis.
But to all the foregoing we shall still add stronger,
and we think, more convincing evidences, when we come
to contemplate the elements of the Sun&mdash;fire, heat, and
light&mdash;in connection with God's intercourse by His
Spirit, and His dealings with man.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>GOD'S THRONE SHALL ENDURE FOREVER;
SO ALSO SHALL THE SUN. CONCLUSIVE
SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE FOR ALL THAT
WE CLAIM.</i></h2>


<p>God hath sworn by His Holiness, that the seed
of David (the <span class="smcap">Messiah</span>), should "endure forever,
and his throne as the Sun before him."</p>

<p>The Psalmist, referring to the Messiah says, "His
name shall endure forever. His name shall be continued
as long as the Sun, and all nations shall call
him blessed." Here we have the assurance of the
eternal duration of the Sun; even as the Throne of
God which is to "endure forever and ever." The
promise is, that</p>

<blockquote><p>"His seed also will I make to endure forever, and his
throne as the days of heaven. Thy throne O God is
forever and ever."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, we see that the Sun and the heaven are to
endure as long as the throne of God, and his throne is
to endure "forever and ever."</p>

<p>Now to us, to all, while dwelling in mortality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the Sun dispenses its blessings alike. "He maketh
the Sun to shine on the evil and on the good, and sendeth
the rain on the just, and on the unjust."</p>

<p>Thus, we see that the Sun is the active agency for
the dispensing of His blessings to man and all animation
on this Earth. Its rays of light and heat penetrate
the bosoms of oceans and seas, and draw up
from "the fountains of the deep" the "liquid element"
in ascending vapor, and condensing it into clouds,
scatter and return it in rains, and gentle showers, to
water and replenish the Earth and make it bring forth
for sustenance of man and beast, and renew the verdure
of nature.</p>

<p>Now do we not see in all this, as in all things else,
that the Sun&mdash;its heat and light&mdash;are God's agencies
in sustaining all things? We have told you that we
could comprehend that it <i>was</i> an agency pervading
and controlling all things. But you have doubtless noticed
the fact that as we have followed up and grasped
the revelations made by Philosophers and Astronomers,
that the ablest of them have failed to comprehend the
<i>nature</i> of the eternal source of fire. All agree in the
one fact, however, that it is derived from the Sun. No
finite mind ever has comprehended, nor, it may be,
ever will be able to fully comprehend it. We know
that it exists. We apply to it properties and principles,
or components which form the element. Beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
this we cannot go, only we know that God himself
is its author; that it is an element intimately connected
with Himself&mdash;nay more, that He has even
revealed to us that <i>His Spirit is fire</i>! And when we
contemplate the fact that it is the only completely destructive,
or <i>annihilating</i> element, and yet one that can
<i>never be destroyed</i>; one that is to purify the righteous,
and yet punish the wicked, we are led to the inevitable
conclusion that it is an <i>attribute</i> of the Great Jehovah.
We believe it an element of creative agency,
one that has existed&mdash;possibly&mdash;from all eternity, and
will continue through all eternity to come. We are
told that God, by His Spirit, is manifest in all His
works. Now, what else than <i>light</i>, and <i>heat</i>, is thus
manifest to us? It is positively <i>the source of all light</i>,
and St. Paul tells us that "All things are made manifest
by light;" while the Psalmist declares "His going
forth is from the <i>end of the heaven</i>, and His circuit unto
the ends of it, and there is nothing hid from the <i>heat</i>
thereof."</p>

<p>Now we see that this declaration establishes our
hypothesis of the location of heaven. His going forth
from the <i>end of the heaven</i>&mdash;from the sun&mdash;and nothing
is hid from the heat thereof&mdash;the Sun being the source
of heat&mdash;is conclusive evidence that the <i>Sun</i> is near&mdash;even
at the <i>ends</i> of the heaven.</p>

<p>In the further contemplation of the hypothesis, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the Spirit of God is <i>as</i> fire, you will remember that we
have stated that some of the constituent elements of
fire pervades all things, and also that God&mdash;<i>by His
Spirit</i>&mdash;is everywhere, and in all His works. Hear the
Psalmist, on this subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Whither shall I go from thy <i>Spirit</i>? Whither shall I
flee from thy presence? If I ascend up into heaven, thou
art there; if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea, even there thy hand shall lead me,
and thy right hand shall hold me.</p>

<p>"If I say, surely the darkness shall cover me; even the
night shall be light about me. Yea, the darkness hideth
not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkness
and the light are both alike to thee."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark well this testimony, that while the Spirit of
God is everywhere, so, also, is that Spirit <i>light</i>, and
there is no darkness, save to those vailed in humanity.
When spirit is free from mortality; is accepted of
God, and clothed upon with immortality; <i>as spirit</i>, it
partakes of His own nature, and will, henceforth,
dwell forever in eternal light.</p>

<p>Now what the Sun is to this earth and its inhabitants,
so also we believe it to be to the inhabitants of
all the other planets belonging to its system; all of
which worlds it controls, even as it does this. And
here the mind goes out in the contemplation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
hypothesis, that all those other suns, standing far out in
sidereal regions&mdash;each governing and controlling its
own system of planets, or worlds&mdash;are also <i>heavens</i> for
created intelligences inhabiting such planets. God is
Infinite, as well as Omnipresent. Infinite in wisdom,
and in His creative power.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who can set bounds to the Almighty?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Therefore <i>Suns</i>, and consequently <i>heavens</i>, may be
numbered by <i>millions</i>, and their surrounding worlds by
<i>billions</i>; yet all created, governed, and controlled by
the infinite wisdom and power of the great Architect of
the Universe. Such hypothesis is wonderful for finite
minds to contemplate, yet not more so than the fact of
the existence of our own solar system.</p>

<p>That the Sun shall endure forever, no rational mind
can doubt. God's own word assures this, and that His
throne shall endure as long as the Sun. Should He
quench the fires of the Sun, and yet make no other
provision for light and heat, all would be blackness,
darkness, and desolation, and no animated life could
exist on this earth, or surrounding worlds.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Having assumed the hypothesis that that which we
denominate the <span class="smcap">Sun</span> is a volume of <i>photospheric-ethereal</i>,
or <small>SPIRIT-FIRE</small>; that it is the source of all that we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
comprehend of <i>light</i> and <i>heat</i>; we have also stated our
belief that it is an <i>attribute</i> of the Eternal One&mdash;possibly
an agency of <i>creative power</i>&mdash;we believe we shall be
able to make this plain to every reflecting mind, in our
further contemplations of the revelations which God
has made of himself, as we find them recorded in the
Bible. These revelations are plain, and we believe the
time in the history of our world has come, when we
should more fully comprehend them&mdash;even the nature
of His manifestations, and thus comprehend more our
own relations to Him, and by this means be enabled to
"come to a knowledge of His truth," and more fully
realize His prescience, day by day. That this has not
been more fully comprehended heretofore, must seem a
mystery to every reflecting mind.</p>

<p>Now what are these revelations? Let us examine.</p>

<p>We learn from Bible History, that "God created
man in His own image, and after His own likeness."
"In the image of God created He him; male and female,
created He them." Thus, in creation, man is
spoken of in the <i>plural</i>. "And the Lord God formed
man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul." Now "the first Adam was made a living soul, and
the second Adam a quickening spirit." The terms soul
and spirit are held as synonymous; both having reference
to our immortal nature, and, as this immortal nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
emanated from God our Creator, and is of His
own eternal attribute, it can never die; hence, it must
exist through all eternity.</p>

<p>Job asks, "To whom hast Thou uttered words?
whose spirit came from Thee?" and in Ecclesiastes it
is declared, "The spirit shall return to God who gave
it." St. John, the revelator, tells us that "God is a
spirit: and they that worship Him must worship Him
in spirit and in truth." While St. Paul says, "His
spirit beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the
children of God."</p>

<p>Now you will remember that St. John, the revelator,
has told us that it was revealed to him that "the seven
lamps of <i>fire</i>, were the seven spirits of God," while Job
says, "A flame goeth out of His mouth, and God by
his spirit garnished the heavens."</p>

<p>We wish you to bear this evidence in mind. For
Job not only speaks of a <i>plurality of heavens</i>, but explains
by what agency they were garnished&mdash;even by
the <i>Spirit of God</i>. Now we know that garnishment is
transcendent brightness, and brilliancy; to adorn and
polish <i>surface</i>. Is it not therefore, probable that Job
had reference to that bright <i>ethereal spirit flame</i>, whose
brilliancy blinds us if we attempt a lingering gaze at
the Sun's bright disk? 'Tis said that heaven within is
lighted with the "glory of God."</p>

<p>In our previous arguments, we have showed, conclusively,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
that the Sun is the source of fire, heat, and
light. Let us now further examine the offices of this
element thus derived from the <i>Sun</i>, and note in this
investigation whether it is not, in some way, intimately
connected with <i>heaven</i>.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> Under the Mosaic dispensation, God commanded
His Prophets, and Priests, to build unto Him
an Altar, and to offer sacrifices thereon; and such sacrifices
would be accepted by Him, as should be evidenced
by his sending down fire from heaven to consume
the offerings. He also commanded, through Moses,
that the fires should ever be burning upon the altar,
and that the Priests should continue to renew sacrifices
and burnt offerings upon it. These sacrifices were as
memorials before the Lord, and typical of the coming of
Christ, who should be the "great sacrifice," to ransom
fallen man.</p>

<p>Now it will be remembered that when such offerings
were made, fire came down from heaven and consumed
the offerings, and thus made manifest that the sacrifices
were accepted of God. (Let it be remembered that we
have shown, as far as finite mind can comprehend, that
the <i>Sun</i> is the only direct source of fire, and then remember
that <i>fire came down from heaven</i>.)</p>

<p>In the book of Job we read,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The fire of God has fallen from heaven.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>The Psalmist tells us that</p>

<blockquote><p>"God is a <i>Sun</i> and a shield, who maketh His angels
spirits, and His ministers a flaming fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we know that angels are God's ministers,
and how oft do we find recorded in the Bible, how&mdash;under
the earlier dispensation&mdash;they appeared on earth
in forms of <i>fire</i>, and with the brightness of the <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p>The Psalmist tells us again that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Our God shall come, a fire shall devour before Him.
A fire goeth before Him and burneth up His enemies."</p></blockquote>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah proclaims:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Wherefore, thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Behold,
I will make my words in thy mouth fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Psalmist answers:</p>

<blockquote><p>"While I was musing the fire burned."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, how plain the revelations that <i>God's Spirit is
fire</i>. Not necessarily manifested at all times, by the
burning and consuming our mortal bodies&mdash;this only in
His <i>wrath</i>&mdash;but by the purifying of our natures;
"burning up the dross, and base desires," and thus
fitting us for the enjoyment of heaven and happiness,
for</p>

<blockquote><p>"He shall be as a refiner's fire, and the righteous are
saved as by fire."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Let us hear what the prophet Jeremiah saith:</p>

<blockquote><p>"For behold the Lord will come with fire; and with His
chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and
His rebukes with flames of fire, and the slain of the Lord
shall be many."</p></blockquote>

<p>Ah, when He comes forth with His <i>Spirit of fire</i> in
<i>wrath</i> and indignation, then it is that this element is
one of terrible destruction. Comprehending this, the
a same prophet inquires:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Who among us shall dwell with devouring fire? Who
among <i>us</i> shall dwell in everlasting burnings?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Hear the answer of God, given through his prophet
to all His obedient and faithful children:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Though thou walkest through the fires, thou shalt not
be burned, neither shall the flames kindle upon thee."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, of His Spirit in a milder form:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Is not my <i>word</i> like fire, saith the Lord?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The prophet answers:</p>

<blockquote><p>"His word was in my heart as a burning fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now remember that:</p>

<blockquote><p>"By the <i>word</i> of the Lord were the heavens made, and
all the hosts of them by the breath of His mouth."</p></blockquote>

<p><i>And here His word is represented as</i> <small>FIRE</small>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>In the first book of the Chronicles it is written:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every man's work shall be tried by fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>And, in the second book of the Chronicles:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And when the children of Israel saw how the fire came
down, and the glory of the Lord upon the House, they
bowed themselves with their faces to the ground, and worshipped
and praised the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, no one dared gaze on the brightness of that
<i>glory</i>, and all bowed "with their faces <i>to the ground</i>."</p>

<p>Turning to the book of Deuteronomy, we find
written:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Lord thy God is a consuming fire. Understand
therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is He that goeth
over before thee as a consuming fire. Out of heaven He
made thee to hear His voice, that He might instruct thee;
and upon earth He showed thee His great fire; and thou
heardest His words out of the midst of the fire."</p></blockquote>

<p>In Leviticus we find written:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And there went out a fire from the Lord and devoured
them, and they died before the Lord. And there came a
fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar
the burnt offerings&mdash;which, when the people saw, they
shouted and fell on their faces."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let us contemplate, for a moment, the sacrilege of
the attempt at using this element&mdash;during the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dispensation&mdash;to the consuming of an offering or sacrifice
to any other than the <i>one true and living God</i>. Turn to
the Book of Numbers, and read,</p>

<blockquote><p>"When the people offered incense upon the strange
altar, there came down fire from the Lord and consumed
the two hundred and fifty who offered the incense. And
Nahab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before
the Lord."</p></blockquote>

<p>Second Kings, vi. 17:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Elisha said, they that be for us are more than they
that are against us; he prayed, and God opened the young
man's eyes, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was
full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we see that this element&mdash;in its destructive
form&mdash;is the ready manifestation of God's displeasure.</p>

<p>Turn to Exodus, and read,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him (Moses),
in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, and he looked,
and behold the bush burned with fire, and the bush was
not consumed." <i>Again</i>, "The cloud of the Lord was upon
the Tabernacle by day, and a fire was upon it by night in
sight of all the house of Israel." <i>Again</i>, "And the sight of
the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire upon the top
of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now let us consider this element in its offices when
controlled by the Great Jehovah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>Judges, xiii. 20:</p>

<blockquote><p>"For it came to pass when the flame went up toward
heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the Lord ascended
in the flame of the altar."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here there was no delusive manifestation, but the
actual <i>flame of fire</i>, ascending upward toward heaven;
even to the <i>Sun</i> its original source.</p>

<p>We will now turn to the Book of the Second Kings,
and&mdash;in our mind's eye&mdash;join the prophets "as they
walked and talked with Elijah" and witness one of the
most sublime scenes the eye of man has ever beheld:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And it came to pass as they still went on and talked,
that behold there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of
fire, and parted them both asunder, and Elijah went up by
a whirlwind into heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>Was there not a startling, and sublime revelation,
that this element controlled, can be suited, even to
our enjoyment of <i>happiness</i> when the great change
comes; when this mortal shall put on immortality?</p>

<p>In the Book of Malachi&mdash;the last of the Old Testament
scriptures&mdash;we hear the voice of Him who had
promised deliverance, speaking to us through His
prophet:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Unto you that fear my name, shall the <i>Sun</i> of righteousness
arise."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>Thus we see that the promised Messiah was spoken
of as a <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p>Turning to the record of the New Testament, we
find the Saviour's advent into this world signaled by a
brilliant "Star," emblematical of the <i>Sun</i>, shining in
all its splendor, brilliancy, and beauty, and leading the
wise men to where lay the "Infant of days"&mdash;the veiled
"Star," or <i>Sun</i>, of light and immortality.</p>

<p>At a later day, behold Him manifesting His veiled
brightness, as he stood "<i>transfigured on the Mount</i>"
before Peter, James and John, when "<i>His face did shine
as the Sun, and His raiment white as the light</i>."</p>

<p>But we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon all the
symbols of <i>fire</i>, <i>heat</i>, and <i>light</i>, so clearly representative,
which may be found interspersed throughout the
Old, and the New Testament pages. We will catch up
a few others as we pass along, before, in mind, taking
our stand with John, the revelator, on the Isle of Patmos.
St. Paul tells us,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His
mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that
know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord
Jesus Christ." And that the "Lord shall consume with the
spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness
of His coming."</p></blockquote>

<p>St. John, says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>"<i>I indeed baptize you with water, but he that cometh
after me is mightier than I, he shall baptize you with the
Holy Ghost and</i> <small>WITH FIRE</small>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus we see that <i>spirit</i> is denominated <i>fire</i> in the
ordinance of <i>Spiritual Baptism</i>.</p>

<p>And St. Paul says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"By one spirit are we all baptized into one body."</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Let us now glance at the account of John's spiritual
vision while on the Isle of Patmos, as recorded in the
Book of Revelation:</p>

<p>"I heard behind me a great voice as the voice of a
trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and
the last, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord,
which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
Almighty. And I turned to see the voice that spake
with me, and I saw seven golden candlesticks, and One
in the midst of the candlesticks like unto the Son of
Man. His head and his hair were white as the snow,
and his eyes were as <i>flames of fire</i>, and his feet like unto
fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace, and his voice
as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right
hand seven stars; and out of his mouth went a sharp
two-edged sword; <i>and his countenance was as the Sun
shining in his strength</i>."</p>

<p>John saw the door of heaven opened and a voice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of a trumpet said unto him, "Come up hither, and I
will shew thee the things which must be hereafter." He
continues. "And immediately I was in the spirit, and,
behold a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the
throne, who, to look upon was like jasper, and there
was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like
unto an emerald, and around the throne sat four and
twenty elders in raiment of white, and out of the throne
proceeded lightnings, and thunderings, and voices, and
there were seven lamps of <i>fire</i> burning before the throne,
<i>which are the seven spirits of God</i>. And the temple of
God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his
temple the ark of his testament, and there were lightnings,
and voices, and thunderings. And there appeared
a great wonder in heaven, <i>a woman clothed with the
Sun</i>. And I saw another mighty angel coming down
from heaven clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was
upon his head and his face was, as it were the <i>Sun</i>,
and his feet as pillars of <i>fire</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>And the city had no need of the Sun</i>, for the glory
of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."
"And there shall be no night there, for the Lord
God giveth them light, and they shall reign forever and
ever. The Lord God shall be unto them an everlasting
light, and the days of their mourning shall be
ended."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p><p>"<i>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the
Kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear let him
hear.</i>" (Matt. xiii. 43.)</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We have quoted the foregoing Scriptural passages&mdash;to
which we might add scores of others of similar import&mdash;to
show the connection of the element of fire,
heat and light&mdash;with God himself, and that while it
proves the agency; at least in dispensing His blessings
to all animated life, and can be so controlled by Him
that&mdash;even in its intensity&mdash;it cannot harm the righteous,
either in body or spirit, when He interposes;
yet it is the certain agency of destruction, and the torment
of the wicked at His will; or without this interposition.
Certain it is, that it is the <i>agency</i> by which
He has made Himself manifest to man, and this agency
still continues in the dispensing of all the manifold
blessings we enjoy, day by day, and should cause every
heart to turn to Him with reverence and grateful emotions.
The mind of the Christian world should acknowledge
the omnipresence of the Infinite One; that
He pervades all space, and is manifest in all things;
while each individual should feel as Elihu did when he
uttered the words, "The <i>Spirit</i> of God hath made me,
and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life;"
and exclaim with the Psalmist:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I will bless the Lord at all times, His praise shall continually
be in my mouth. The eyes of the Lord are ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry.
O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name
together. God is our refuge and strength, a very present
help in trouble." "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
in all generations. Before the mountains were brought
forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we have seen that God&mdash;by His Spirit, or influence&mdash;is
everywhere; that he pervades the universe
of His Creation; that his nature is eternal and indestructible,
while all else&mdash;save man's immortal nature
derived from God&mdash;is destructible. We are plainly
told in the Bible that the <i>Spirit of God is fire</i>; that
<i>His Word is fire</i>; that He is like a <i>refiner's fire</i>&mdash;even
as a purifier of silver. That every man's work shall be
tried <i>by fire</i>; the righteous saved as by <i>fire</i>; that, to his
people, He will be as <i>a wall of fire</i>; and though they
pass through the fire they shall not be burned; neither
shall the flames kindle upon them. And yet our God
is a <i>consuming fire</i>, before whom the wicked shall not
stand. That the <i>fire</i> of His anger, and His <i>wrath</i>,
shall be kindled against them, when all the proud, yea,
and all that do wickedly shall be cast into the fire that
will never be quenched; whose flames shall ascend up
forever and ever. Oh, how plain the revelations of
God as to the immortality of the soul, and a future
state of existence! The righteous to enter into, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
enjoy eternal life; the wicked&mdash;who are dead in trespasses
and in sins&mdash;to enter into eternal death, even
the "death that never dies."</p>

<p>How <i>startling</i> the fact of these plain revelations!
God is now made manifest to our daily and hourly
comprehension. How dare we trifle with Him, and
our own soul's immortal interest? We are daily and
hourly rushing on to our own eternal destiny. Ere another
year, a month, a week or day is past, we may
realize that "it is not all of life to live, nor yet of death
to die." No one can escape the eternal fiat of Jehovah,
"<i>dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return</i>."
As death leaves the body so judgment finds the soul.
"The righteous shall inherit eternal life;" "the wicked
shall be driven away from the presence of God, and
from the glory of His power," and take up their abode
with tormenting devils "in everlasting burnings."</p>

<p>Stop, poor wandering child of sin; yield obedience
to the requirements of God's law; "acknowledge Him
in all thy ways, and He shall direct thy paths."</p>

<p>The Psalmist tells us that "<i>the Lord God is a Sun</i>."
Saint John tells us that, while in the Spirit, it was
revealed to him that the "<i>burning lamps of fire were
spirits of God</i>." Now remember that we have told you
that the vast volume of flame of <i>ethereal fire outside</i> and
<i>around</i> the heavenly world, is all that we can see or
comprehend as the <i>Sun</i>; that flame is the source of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<i>light</i>, heat, and animation: hence, considered in connexion
with its offices, may we not safely conclude that
it is an <i>attribute of Jehovah</i>?</p>

<p>The prophet Malachi foretold the coming of the
"Sun of righteousness," behold the "star in the east!"
Who can doubt this star being a visible manifestation
of the <i>Spirit of God</i>? Christ, the Son of God, is called
"the <i>Sun</i> of righteousness; the bright morning star."
His advent into the world was signalized by this sacred
emblem&mdash;even by the <i>Spirit of God</i> revealed as the
<i>brightness of a star</i>. How appropriate this representation,
when the Son of God came to usher in the light
of an eternal day to his people. Transfigured during
His stay on earth, "His face did shine as the Sun, and
His raiment was white as the light." Now remember,
we are assured that the heavenly world and city "hath
no need of the <i>Sun</i>, for the glory of God doth lighten
it, and the Lamb (the Son of God) is the light thereof."</p>

<p>Thus we think we have furnished conclusive Scripture
evidence that <i>God's Spirit is manifested by fire</i>.
Fire is the source of all light, and is also an element
pervading all things throughout the vast universe of
God&mdash;in air and earth, seas and floods, rocks and
mountains, throughout all heights and depths. Hence,
hear again the exclamation of the Psalmist: "Whither
shall I go from thy <i>Spirit</i>? or whither shall I flee from
thy presence?" Behold, God, by His Spirit, is everywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
even throughout the vast extended universe of
all His wondrous works.</p>

<p>We have but to consider the source of this element&mdash;which
is God himself&mdash;and we shall then easily comprehend
how it can, by the same power, be adapted or
made congenial to our mortal or immortal natures.
We have said, He has created no element incompatible
with, or uncongenial to His own nature, nor any that
He cannot adapt to the condition of the spirit-life of
His children. Fire is an element destructive of all
things else save immortality, and that it is not destructive
of this, we have evidence in the fact that the wicked
shall be cast into the flames of hell, and suffer its torments
for ever and ever. And yet, while it is an element
destructive of all else, save immortality, it is one,
and the <i>only one</i> we can&mdash;even partially&mdash;comprehend,
that can <i>never be destroyed</i>. Mortality shall be destroyed,
and naught remain but immortality, purified
by fire&mdash;<i>the Spirit of God</i>.</p>

<p>Now in order that His children <i>here</i>, might comprehend
His infinite power in controlling, or adapting this
element to their happiness, He has manifested this
power even with mortality on this earth. Our mortal
bodies are susceptible of feeling its painful influences,
and of being destroyed by it&mdash;save when He intervenes,
and changes our nature so that it can have no impression
upon us, or makes it a congenial element in which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
can enjoy happiness. That He can do, and has done
this, we have manifest in the miraculous preservation
of the three Hebrew children. For their refusal to forsake
the Living God, and worship the idol, or golden
image set up by King Nebuchadnezzar, the king commanded
that the furnace should be heated seven-fold,
and they be bound and cast into it. This was done,
and while the heat was so intense as to destroy those
who bore them to, and plunged them into the fiery furnace,
yet when the king looked into it "he saw four men
loose and walking in the midst of the flames; praising
God, and blessing the name of the Lord, and the
fourth was like unto the Son of God." The king called
them to come forth, and when the three who were cast
in came forth, "not a hair of their heads was singed,
nor even the smell of fire passed on their garments."</p>

<p>Thus we see the power of God manifest in the
adaptation at His own will, of this,&mdash;to our mortal
bodies&mdash;painful and consuming element, to our condition
of happiness. And, on the other hand, when this
saving power is withheld, how certain is destruction, as
manifested by its destroying those who approached near
enough to the furnace to cast them in. O, the measure
of happiness those children of the Most High enjoyed
in the midst of the burning flames! shouting and praising
God. And when they came out of the fiery furnace,
they still continued their triumphant shout; calling upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
everything&mdash;animate, and inanimate&mdash;throughout
the vast Universe, to "bless, praise and magnify the
name of the Lord forever."</p>

<p>That God can, and does make this element suited
to the enjoyment of happiness of His people, we have
also seen manifested in the case of Elijah taking his
seat, at the command of God, in the "chariot of fire,"
and with "horses of fire" ascending up into heaven.
Thus, "changed," as the apostle expresses it, "in the
twinkling of an eye," his mortality ceased, and "clothed
upon with immortality," by Divine power, he could ride
in triumph with his steeds of fire, sitting in his chariot
of <i>burning flame</i>.</p>

<p>We scarcely deem it necessary to refer again to the&mdash;almost
universally conceded&mdash;fact of man's immortal
nature. By the breath of God, man was made a living
soul or spirit. God's spirit is <i>living fire</i>; hence this
immortal nature of man is <i>living fire</i>, an attribute of
God himself, and one which can never cease to exist;
can never be annihilated, but will live on, and on
through all eternity. But when this immortal principle
of <i>spirit-fire</i> leaves the body, mortality ceases to live,
and must decay and moulder into dust. For, speaking
of this mortal body, He hath said, "dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return," and "the soul shall return
to God who gave it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>SUN AND HEAVEN.</i></h2>


<p>Now to show the intimate connexion with the
<i>Sun</i> and <i>Heaven</i>, spoken of in the Scriptures,
we will here group together a few of the many
passages found written therein.</p>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah, in referring to the great and
terrible day of the Lord, says "the light shall be darkened
in the heavens;" and in the Gospel according to
St. Mark, referring to the same, we read that "the <i>Sun</i>
shall be darkened;" and in the Revelation, that "the <i>Sun</i>
and the air were darkened." Again, Jehovah, speaking
to His people, saith: "I will cover the <i>heaven</i>, and
make the stars thereof dark;" and, in order that we
may more fully comprehend, he added: "I will cover
the <i>Sun</i> with a cloud;" and the Psalmist tells us that
"He covereth the <i>heaven</i> with a cloud;" and thus saith
the Lord through His prophet: "Be not dismayed at
the signs of <i>heaven</i>; for the heathen are dismayed at
them."</p>

<p>Thus we see that the <i>Sun</i> and <i>heaven</i> are often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
spoken of in connexion with each other in regard to
light. The Sun is to us the source of <i>all light</i>, and in
covering the <i>heaven</i> He covereth the Sun. But we see,
as above, that He hath made this matter plain to our
comprehension by His own utterance: "<i>Be not dismayed
by the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed
at them.</i>"</p>

<p>Now you will remember that the heathen, in
ancient times&mdash;and even so with them at the present
day&mdash;were always dismayed and frightened at the recurrence
of an eclipse of the Sun, and imagined the time
of the world had come to an end. But the science of
astronomy has comprehended the laws of nature, and
has revealed the true causes of these seeming phenomena
to the enlightenment of the world, and many years
previous to their occurrence. Astronomers can foretell
the day, the hour, and even the very moment when they
will appear, or be visible in any part of the world, as,
also, when they will disappear. But we see, however,
that God himself has spoken of such eclipses as "signs
in the <i>heaven</i>," and yet they are eclipses of the <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p>But still more pointed and clear is the evidence of
their connexion given by the Saviour, where the Pharisees
and Sadducees desired him to show them "<i>a sign
from heaven</i>." Hear His answer: "When it is evening,
ye say, It will be fair-weather, for the sky is red;
and in the morning, It will be foul weather to-day, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites! ye can
discern the face of the sky, but ye cannot discern the
signs of the times." Now we here see that they asked
Him for a sign from <i>heaven</i>, and the Saviour answered
promptly by referring to the apparent phenomena produced
by the disappearing and reappearing of the <i>Sun</i>.
Thus answering by signs which <i>they</i> had marked;
<i>produced by the Sun</i>, which covereth the heaven from
our view.</p>

<p>We have shown what all must acknowledge; that
the <i>Sun</i> is the only source of fire, heat, and light which
is comprehended in Nature. Revelations of the Past,
and predictions as to the Future, assure us that God's
<i>wrath</i> is revealed by <i>fire</i>. Now from whence cometh
this fire when His wrath is thus revealed? God rained
down fire and brimstone from heaven upon Sodom and
Gomorrah, and thus destroyed those cities and their
wicked inhabitants. Now, as the <i>wrath</i> of God is
revealed by <i>fire</i>, St. Paul sets this matter at rest. Hear
him: "<i>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against
all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</i>" Thus, His
spirit of wrath is manifested by fire; the <i>source</i> of fire
is the <i>Sun</i>, and He sends <i>fire from heaven</i>. Hence, we
cannot for a moment doubt the correctness of our
hypothesis that the source of fire, as manifested in the
Past, and also that which shall be manifested in the
Future, is the <i>Sun</i>. And wherein it is declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
fire came down from heaven, or out of heaven, it was
natural that such expressions were used, because it was
held that God resided in heaven, and He sent down
fire from thence to execute His judgments.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>A PLURALITY OF HEAVENS.</i></h2>


<p>The idea of a <i>plurality of heavens</i>, and their
numbers almost infinite, would seem at first
thought to startle the mind, and disarrange all
our conceptions of the extent and machinery of the
universe, and of the employment of God, and all the
angels, and other intelligences He has made. Yet its
truth only brings home to us the insignificance of our
own earth, and still more that of ourselves. We are
too prone to think that this earth and its inhabitants
are the principal objects of the Creator's care, and that
<i>man</i> is of vast importance in the order of His arrangements,
and of augmenting His kingdom and glory.
While the truth is, our world is insignificant, when compared
to His wonderful creations, and each individual
as but a single grain of sand among all that may be
found upon the shores of oceans and seas. And yet
all that He hath made <i>are</i> the objects of His government
and care. For "not even a sparrow falleth to
the ground" unknown to Him.</p>

<p>That in His omnipotent and infinite power He can,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and has created separate systems of planet-worlds, and
a central sun and heaven for controlling each, we cannot
doubt; neither is there more of incomprehensible
mystery in this contemplation than in that of our own
system of planets, with its central and controlling <i>Sun</i>
and heaven.</p>

<p>Let us turn to revelations made, as recorded in the
Bible, and see if there are not declarations which sustain
this hypothesis. In the second book of the Kings
it is written: "<i>But will God indeed dwell on earth? behold,
the heaven, and heaven of heavens cannot contain
him</i>;" and in the second book of the Chronicles:
"<i>But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven,
and heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</i>" The Psalmist
says: "<i>The heavens; even the heavens are the Lord's</i>,"
and "<i>The heavens declare the glory of God</i>," and that
"<i>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and
all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.</i>"</p>

<p>Thus we have conclusive evidence of a <i>plurality of
heavens</i>, while, possibly, their numbers are <i>millions</i>,
their surrounding planet-worlds <i>billions</i>, with a wide
expanse of surrounding "firmament of the heavens"
bestrewn with "<i>glittering gems</i>," standing out the grand
<i>empyrean</i> covering of all.</p>

<p>Says Dr. Nichol:</p>

<p>"Mystery, indeed, heavy, almost oppressive, hangs
over all the perceptive; but the shapes strown through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
that bewildering territory have nothing in common
with the fantastic creations of a dream. It is the
essence of these nebulæ that they are not formless, but,
on the contrary, impressed indelibly by system on the
grandest scale; clearly as a leaf they have organism;
something has seized on their enormous volumes, and
moulded them into a wonderful order." Says Child:
"Thus every thing bears the mark of order impressed
upon it by the Almighty hand. That noble gift of God
to man&mdash;the telescope&mdash;has magnified Him by driving
away every semblance of <i>chance</i> from the firmament,
and by exhibiting in its place designs and established
law. Up there, as down here, the idea of irregularity
or chance is but the suggestion of our ignorance."</p>

<p>Thus, from a knowledge gained through that wonderful,
and yet most exact of all sciences&mdash;Astronomy&mdash;we
base our conclusions. <i>That</i> science is the grandest,
most perfect, and comprehensive of all sciences
known to the human mind. It grasps, analyzes, and
comprehends the laws and forces which make up and
control the universe, and every other science known is
intimately connected with, or based upon it. There is
no chance-work in Nature; all things are moulded and
formed complete by the great Architect, whose Word
created them, and all the grand panorama of suns,
moons, planets, worlds, and stars, are perfect and in
the exact order of His creative wisdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Whatever of incomprehensible mystery our hypothesis
of those far-distant <i>suns</i> and <i>heavens</i> may involve,
we feel satisfied of the correctness of our theory in
regard to our own, and our mind is equally impressed
with the probability of all the other planets belonging
to the Sun's domain, being inhabited by living intelligences,
and that, in the order of their Creator's arrangement,
they too find their heaven of eternal existence
there. We know there is room for all and to spare,
within that heavenly empire, and would be if they and
our own earth should remain repeopling and passing
thither for cycles of ages to come; for, as we have seen
from astronomical measurement, it is computed to be
more than one million times the size of this earth.</p>

<p>How enrapturing the thought, that there we may
not only meet the prophets and seers of old; the
apostles and martyrs; "those who went up through
great tribulations," "who washed their robes and made
them white in the blood of the Lamb;" our counselling
ministers, who have assisted us in the way; there
the loved ones of our hearts, who have already left us
and this world of "sin and sorrow," and are now safely
at "home;" there other loved ones who are yet
on this earth and are striving with us for a home in
that "better land;" but also, perhaps, there we shall
meet messengers, and children of God from all the
other worlds belonging to the Sun, or that heaven's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
domain; and with the innumerable company of angels,
and all the ransomed hosts, dwell forever with our
Saviour in the glory-light of the Spirit of God. O, who
will not seek and strive for a <i>home in heaven</i>?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>A PLACE FOR THE WICKED.</i></h2>


<p>That there are two separate places and conditions&mdash;one
for the righteous and the other
for the wicked&mdash;we cannot doubt. In regard
to no other fact are the revelations of God and declarations
of the Scriptures more clear and explicit. This
of itself should startle every inhabitant of Earth; cause
due and solemn reflection; and incline every one to
search for light, and truth, and for the way of salvation.</p>

<p>In stating the facts contained in this volume, it has
not been our design to indulge in a tirade against those
who seem careless and indifferent in regard to their
own souls' eternal interest. If our picture makes the
final doom of the wicked a fearful one, we have only
presented the declarations of God through his prophets,
and of the Saviour and his apostles. These
declarations are startling, when properly considered,
and should awaken every mind to the consideration
of what must be their final destiny, if they continue to
neglect the overtures of mercy. The law of God is
fearful in its denunciations against the wicked, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
sentence will be sternly executed. Therefore we would
"persuade all to be Christians."</p>

<p>If all the inhabitants of this Earth&mdash;all who have
lived during the past, or may live and die on it through
long ages to come&mdash;were saved and should go to dwell
in that heavenly world, there would still be room there
for more. Yea, even then, untold millions of chambers,
ready and beautifully furnished by the Saviour in that
vast and glittering "City of God," would still be unoccupied.
And to the wicked, who will not turn from
their evil ways, is lost forever the privilege of occupying
those mansions; of walking the gold paved streets;
of "drinking the waters from the fountains of life;" of
wandering amidst the "shady groves," and along the
banks of the beautiful rivers; of traversing valleys, and
ascending the "hills and mountains of the Lord," and
of plucking and eating the "ambrosial fruits" that
grow on "the trees of life;" of having wealth and
honor, and a safe and permanent home with the angels;
the Prophets and Apostles of old; with Moses,
and David, and Elijah; with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and with all the great and good of every age
and clime&mdash;even with all "the redeemed of the Lord"
"who have washed their robes and made them white
in the blood of the Lamb"&mdash;with kindred friends from
Earth; with angels and spirits of just ones made perfect,
yea, "<i>with all the ransomed hosts</i>," and above all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
with Christ, the Son of God, who is, and will there be
King and ruler forever.</p>

<p>And for what are all these exchanged? Let us see.
The Bible is the sure Word of God. It tells us that
"the wicked shall be driven away in their wickedness;"
that they "shall be cast into outer darkness, where
shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth."</p>

<p>They "shall be turned into hell with all the nations
that forget God:" "They shall be cast into the lake of
fire, and the smoke of their torment shall ascend up
forever and ever." "These shall go away into everlasting
punishment," "But the righteous into life eternal."
The blessed Saviour, who died that they <i>might</i> have
eternal life, "shall say unto those on his left hand (the
wicked), depart into everlasting fire;" while to those
on his right hand (the righteous), "Come, ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you before
the foundation of the world;" "enter thou into
the joys of thy Lord."</p>

<p>Yes, reader, God has prepared the two places, and
it rests with <i>you</i>&mdash;as a free moral agent&mdash;to make your
choice, and act accordingly. He will never drag you
into heaven by force. You are the rightful inheritor
of a precious immortal soul. He has prepared a place
of perpetual happiness, and <i>invites</i> you to come to it.
There you may find a home, with peace, love and joy.
There is for you honor and wealth, and a "crown of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
glory." There the fountains, and "rivers of life," and
an abundance of spiritual food. There neither decrepitude
nor old age, nor sickness, sorrow, pain, nor death;
but the bloom of eternal youth and beauty may rest
on thy brow forever. Make your choice, and make it
<i>now</i>, for delays are dangerous, and death and the judgment
may be near unto you. The <i>spirit-fire</i> of God's
love is now kindling in your heart, and I hear you say,
"<i>yes</i>, I would like to be there." We implore you,
quench not that <i>spirit-fire</i> of love, or it will change to a
consuming <small>SPIRIT-FIRE OF WRATH</small>, and when your soul
is released from the body, that spirit-fire will become
an intense burning flame, and will be your torment
forever and ever.</p>

<p>The very thought of enduring <i>forever</i>&mdash;after this
short life has past&mdash;should startle the mind of every
intelligent being, and cause the most serious reflections.
None can save but God, and this salvation is through
His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. All must go to Him.
Our ministers can only advise and instruct, and to do
this properly, they must themselves be holy men of
God. Christ Himself assumed the office of the
Priesthood. He made the atonement. He is now our
<i>only</i> High Priest, and all must go to Him. The wealth
of the universe, given to an earthly Pope, Bishop, or
Priest, could not save one single soul, nor purchase it
from perdition. And yet salvation is freely offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
all who will forsake their wicked ways, and come to
God through love, and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>All are convinced of the immortality of the soul,
and of a future state of existence. The Word of God
has set this matter at rest, while it is fully evidenced
by the inherent desire in every heart and mind that it
should be so; even this "longing after immortality."
So, also, does enlightened reason convince all that there
will be a separation of the righteous from the wicked
in their future conditions. There is no true harmony
of mind and spirit between them even in this world;
much less could there be when the righteous are made
pure and clean by the "blood of the Lamb."</p>

<p>There has always been antagonism between the
"spirit of light" and the "spirit of darkness." The
first gives "light, life, and liberty." The second, darkness,
death, and bondage. The word and revelations
of God teach this fact, while the experience and heart
admonitions of all confirm it. Even the ungodly condemn
wickedness, and yet, strange to say, continue on
in sin. There has, from the beginning, been spiritual
antagonism between the good and the bad, and a consciousness
upon the part of the wicked of their own
wrong-doing. This has been the case ever since wicked
Cain slew his brother Abel; God then pronounced
His curse upon the perpetrator of that wicked deed,
and His curse has stood against all wicked doers from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
that time to the present, and will through all time to
come. Bible history is replete with evidences of His
judgments against them, and plainly tells us that there
are two separate places, one wherein the righteous shall
enjoy happiness and eternal life; the other wherein the
wicked shall be punished, and endure a living death
that never dies, showing us plainly that,</p>

<p>"It is not all of life to live; nor yet of death to die."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Now, the <i>location</i> of that place of torment will claim
a few moments of our attention. Of this we think we
are <i>not</i> left to conjecture alone. We believe our
hypothesis of the location of heaven is correct, and that
we have one equally certain of the location of <i>Hell</i>, and
that each hypothesis strongly corroborates the other.</p>

<p>First, let us take direct testimony; that given by
the Son of God himself, who is to be the judge of all&mdash;even
the "quick" and the "dead." The first are those
quickened into life by the spirit, the last are "those who
are dead in trespasses and in sin."</p>

<p>You will find this evidence in the 16th chapter of
the "Gospel according to Saint Luke." Christ, the Son
God, said,</p>

<blockquote><p>"There was a certain rich man, who was clothed in purple
and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who laid at they
rich man's gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with
the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table; moreover,
the dogs came and licked his sores. And it came to pass
that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into
Abraham's bosom; The rich man also died, and was buried,
and in hell he lifted up his eyes. Being in torments, and
seeing Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom, he cried
and said, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and
cool my parched tongue, for I am tormented in this flame.
But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime
receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus his evil
things, but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.
And beside all this, between us and you there is a great
gulph fixed; so that they who would pass from hence to
you cannot; neither can they pass to us that would come
from thence."</p>

<p>"Then he said, I pray thee, therefore, father, that thou
wouldst send him to my father's house, for I have five brethren;
that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into
this place of torment. Abraham said unto him, they have
Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. And he said,
nay, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the
dead, they will repent. Abraham answered and said unto
him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded though one rose from the dead."</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, we see plainly that there are two separate
places; one for the righteous, who are saved through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
obedience and faith, and the other for the wicked who
are lost through disobedience and unbelief. Nothing
could be more plain, pointed, or conclusive.</p>

<p>Now let us recall to your mind that which we have
related in preceding pages; wherein we have told you
that most Astronomers have agreed upon the fact, or
hypothesis, of two atmospheres around the vast globe
we have denominated heaven. The one next to it appears
to be <i>non-luminous</i>; while the outer one&mdash;around
this&mdash;is <i>luminous</i>, which they denominate <i>photosphere</i>,
to which we have added <i>ethereal</i>, or "<i>spirit-fire</i>." This
is what we see in looking at the Sun, and is the vast
volume of fire, or <i>ethereal flame</i>, that sends out heat
and light to this and other surrounding worlds. This
light and heat extend over a region of the illimitable
space, not less than <i>six thousand millions of miles in extent</i>.
We have endeavored to approximate to the
mind the intense heat of the Sun at its source, but it
far exceeds finite comprehension.</p>

<p>We have also given you the views and suppositions
of able investigators that the extent of that photosphere,
or volume of flame, is vast indeed. It is said
that 'flame-like masses&mdash;some computed to be one hundred
and fifty thousand miles in length&mdash;are piled
upon and overlap each other, and sweep onward in
constant agitation like mountain billows of living fire.'
This, as we have told you, is the source of all fire, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
heat known to us on this Earth, and to all the other
planets of our solar system.</p>

<p>The precise nature and elements of fire, we have
said, we cannot fully comprehend; neither its original
source, save that it emanated from the Great First
Cause. The Sun is its direct source to us, and we
realize it always the same; never augmenting nor
diminishing. We know that it is the source of light to
a vast region around, and, from the offices it performs,
we cannot think less than that it is&mdash;as we have before
said&mdash;an attribute of the Great Jehovah; and especially
this when we consider God's own revelations
as found recorded in the Bible.</p>

<p>In describing the dimensions of the <i>Sun</i>, we have
said it is 2,655,000 miles round it, or to bring this vast
extent nearer our comprehension, we may state that it
would require 321 Earths, the size of this, set side
by side to reach around it, and vast numbers more to
cover its surface, and when thus covered with worlds
like this, the stratum would only be about 8,000 miles
deep, while it is reasonable to estimate that <i>photospheric
flame to be 100,000 miles in depth</i>.</p>

<p>We have mentioned the "<i>inner globe</i>," estimated to
be more than a million times the size of this Earth,
and we have denominated it <i>heaven</i>, and this outside
surrounding volume of ethereal fire we shall denominate
<i>hell</i>, as we believe no other true hypothesis can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
be advanced. And, in assuming this, we believe ourselves
sustained by the revelations of God, as well as
by all we can comprehend of Nature.</p>

<p>In order to incite our minds to know and comprehend
more of Him, and become obedient to His requirements,
God has shown us, by manifestations, His
instrument of destruction and punishment. His prophets
have also announced His threatenings against the
wicked, and have told us that <i>fire</i>&mdash;the element of heat&mdash;is
the instrument with which He will fulfil His
threatened vengeance, and we have seen this manifested
by the destruction of the "cities of the plains"&mdash;even
"Sodom and Gomorrah," as also the destruction
of those who offered incense upon strange altars.</p>

<p>Now as this volume of flame, denominated the <i>Sun</i>, is
the <i>only</i> source of fire; and as fire seems to us one of the
controlling elements of nature, and pervades all things,
and God rained down fire and destroyed those cities,
and also sent down fire and destroyed those who offered
incense on a strange altar, we plainly see where
the fire is that is to be the punishment of the wicked.
That it is said "fire came down from heaven," or "out
of heaven," does not vitiate, but rather confirms our
hypothesis. For God is omnipresent, and dwells in <i>all</i>
heavens, and, from that region, <i>that permanent source
of fire</i>, He commanded&mdash;doubtless&mdash;the concentration
of the rays of the Sun, and it thus came at His command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
from heaven, and fell as flame of fire. But to
prove that our hypothesis as to the location of hell is
correct, we direct your mind again to the narrative of
the Saviour, of the rich man in <i>hell</i>, and Lazarus in
Abraham's bosom. That Abraham was in heaven no
one can doubt, while we are plainly told that the rich
man was "<i>in hell</i>," and, although "afar off," yet within
speaking distance.</p>

<p>How far distant the voice of <i>spirit</i> can be heard, no
one in mortality can know. We know that on this
earth sound is limited because of the density of the
atmosphere, and we realize even here that when the
atmosphere is the more rarified, the greater the distance
of sound. It is computed that the condensed, or earth-atmosphere,
extends outward from the earth about forty
miles. When we have passed this stratum, and have
gained space in the <i>ethereal atmosphere</i>, it may be possible
that the same volume of voice we are accustomed
to here, might be heard thousands, or even millions of
miles distant from us. Heat rarifies atmosphere as we
here realize by the influence of the sun. If the addition
of a few rays of the sun will dissipate the dense
clouds, and so materially rarify our atmosphere at the
distance of ninety-five millions of miles, what may we
suppose the condition of the atmosphere ninety millions
of miles nearer its source? Therefore, we may readily
believe that although Dives, and Abraham, were far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
apart&mdash;possibly thousands of miles&mdash;yet they could see
and converse with each other.</p>

<p>You will remember that astronomers inform us that
there seems a volume of non-luminous atmosphere, or
void, between the outer phostosphere of fire and the
body of that <i>inner globe</i> (which globe we believe is
heaven). Now remember the words of Father Abraham,
"Beside all this, between us and you there is a
great gulph fixed; so that they who would pass from
hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us that
would come from thence." Is not here conclusive evidence
that the two places&mdash;heaven and hell&mdash;are not
in far distant regions from each other?</p>

<p><i>Remember.</i> It is said of the wicked "These shall
go away into outer darkness, there shall be weeping,
and wailing, and gnashing of teeth." When death and
hell shall give up their dead (for the souls of the wicked&mdash;who
are dead in trespasses and in sin&mdash;are still enduring
that death that never dies), and all appear before
the Judgment seat of Christ, where "every one shall
receive according to the deeds done in the body," and
the wicked are "driven from God, and from the glory
of His power," to reach again their eternal destiny, they
will doubtless pass through that dark void, even that
"great gulph fixed between," and there <i>will</i> be weeping
and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>Although we believe the evidence furnished is
conclusive beyond cavil or doubt to every intelligent
mind, yet we will still add more affirmative arguments
which we desire that all should consider.</p>

<p>First, Let us refer again to the declarations&mdash;we
have several times repeated&mdash;of the Prophets and Apostles.
That heaven, and the Holy City in it, hath no
need of the light of the <i>Sun</i>. That the "glory of God
doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof."
That there is no night there, but one eternal day.</p>

<p>Now let us call to your mind the <i>extent</i> of that empire
wherein <i>the Sun does not shine</i>. From astronomical
measurement, we may form in our minds an approximation
of its dimensions. To fix for it a low estimate,
we may safely conclude that the domain proper, is at
least <i>five hundred thousand miles</i> in diameter, and <i>one
million five hundred thousand miles around it</i>. The empire
is vast indeed, so great that, by comparison, we can
form no correct idea of it. We can only approximate
by saying that it would require about <i>one million of
earths</i>, the size of this, to make a globe of equal magnitude.</p>

<p>In order to bring all home to your own reason and
comprehension, let us ask, Where else is it feasible for
so large a place to <i>be</i> whereon, or into which the <i>Sun</i>,
or <i>suns</i>, do not or <i>cannot shine</i>? We have shown you
that suns (the surrounding volumes of photospheric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
ethereal fire) are&mdash;so far as we can comprehend&mdash;the
natural sources of light throughout the Universe of
Jehovah's empire. They seem as God's own <i>eternal
lamps</i>, scattered and placed at His will in different
regions of illimitable space, to illumine the universe
without, and give <i>light everywhere</i>, as also life and
animation to all their surrounding worlds. Each perhaps
to its own, even as our Sun does to its own
planet-worlds. Now when we consider that the fact is
well established by all leading Astronomers that this
outside flame or volume of fire is <i>far out</i> from that
<small>INNER GLOBE</small>, or world, and that between them <i>there is
a void</i>, possibly thousands of miles in depth; that the
fires and light of the <i>Sun</i> have no perceptible effect
upon this non-luminous void&mdash;and, indeed, the void
shields the globe within from the light and heat of the
Sun&mdash;we can readily imagine the wise arrangement of
the Great Architect, and also comprehend the truth of
His own declarations, that heaven is a place where
neither the Sun nor its heat shall light upon its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Now the nature of the <i>element</i> of this intervening
void or space, whether <i>it</i> is <i>ethereal</i> or not, we cannot
now comprehend. That it is a safe covering or shield
to the world within, we can readily suppose. For Sir
John Herschel says that it seems as "an awning or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
screen, protecting the body," or world within, from the
Sun's heat.</p>

<p>But we are not left to conjecture alone, without
philosophical reason in this matter. We know the
laws of gravitation and attraction are fixed and sure,
and upon these universal laws we can base correct conclusions.</p>

<p>The tendency of fire or heat is <i>outward</i> and <i>upward</i>.
The sense in which we use the term "upward"
is that of space far out from the earth, or like solid
bodies. We have shown, in our explanation of the
law of gravitation, that <i>upward</i> is simply away from the
earth. Thus, we ignite material with fire and produce
combustion here, and we see the flame <i>rise</i>, and feel
and know the heat ascends <i>upward</i>. So also may the
Chinaman do the same, at the same moment, on the
opposite side of the globe&mdash;while his position is directly
under us, as we construe downward&mdash;and yet the
flame and heat of his fire ascends <i>upward</i> from the
earth where he stands, which is in a directly opposite
direction from the course ours pursues. Thus, to us,
outward from the earth is <i>upward</i>, no matter where our
position on it.</p>

<p>This tendency of heat upward, or away from the
base of the fire, is plainly evident by the fact that heat
will not penetrate to any considerable depth <i>downward</i>,
neither when on the earth, or on a solid non-combustible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
foundation; nor yet when on an elevated platform,
for its tendency, as we have shown, is always outward
or upward. So also with the fires of the <i>Sun</i>; whatever
the base of its fires may be, we see by the fixed
laws of Nature that the tendency of its heat is <i>outward</i>,
no matter from what portion of that base it may emanate.
We cannot now comprehend the <i>nature</i> of the
base of the Sun's fires, but we know that the great
Jehovah has provided it, and that it is founded in His
wisdom, and is fixed and sure, and we have reasoned
conclusively that it cannot be of combustible material.
Hence, the only rational conclusion we can arrive at&mdash;from
a thorough investigation of Divine revelations;
from all the lights afforded by the science of astronomy;
from the true philosophy of Nature, as well as from all
that is visible and perceptible&mdash;is, that far within the
circling photosphere of ethereal fire which we see and
realize as the <i>Sun</i>, there is a solid body, a globe, a
VAST WORLD, and that world is the heaven for all
the righteous from this earth; that it is the Saviour's
allotted empire, and that He is there the ruler of His
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE NATURE OF THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVENLY
WORLD.</i></h2>

<p class="center">"<i>The glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the
light thereof.</i>"</p>


<p>We have given the above Scripture quotation
repeatedly in these pages, in order to forcibly
impress the minds of all with the fact that the
light of the heavenly world is <i>different</i> from the light of
the Sun; that it far transcends it in <i>brightness</i>. For
we are told that it "is far above the brightness of the
Sun shining in its strength," even "<i>seven-fold brighter
than the Sun</i>."</p>

<p>Let us contemplate what has been revealed of this
"glory light."</p>

<p>First. No <i>mortal</i> ever has beheld the full radiance
of the face, or glory of God. For He hath said that
no one should see His face and live. In evidence of
this, when Moses, who was so near Him, and desired
so much to behold His face unveiled, prayed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Him saying: "I <i>beseech thee</i>, show me thy glory."
There came an answer unto him. "<i>Thou canst not see
my face, for there shall no man see me and live.</i>" And
in order to preserve the life of Moses, God placed him
in the "cleft of a rock" and covered him with His
hand while His glory was passing by.</p>

<p>Others have desired to see God, and the brightness
of His glory, yet such desire, while in mortality, is
wrong, for none could behold it and live.</p>

<p>It is recorded of Trajan, the Emperor of Rome,
that he accosted Rabbi Joshua, saying: "You teach
that your God is everywhere, now I should like to see
Him." Joshua replied, "He cannot be seen, no mortal
eye can behold His glory." The Emperor, however,
persisted, contending that if He was everywhere,
He could surely be seen, and thus derided the doctrine
taught by Joshua. "Well," said the Rabbi, "let us try
first to look at one of His ambassadors." To this
Trajan consented. Joshua then led him forth into the
open air at noon-day, and bade him "look at the <i>Sun</i>."
The Emperor replied: "I cannot, for its light dazzles,
and will <i>blind me</i>." Then replied Joshua, "If thou art
unable to endure the light of one of His creatures, how
canst thou expect to be able to behold the resplendent
glory of the Creator? <i>The sight would annihilate thee.</i>"</p>

<p>Thus we find that in every representation of the
"glory of God," its light is beyond our comprehension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and so overpowering that no mortal could behold it
and live.</p>

<p>We have, however, a feeble representation of this
glory manifested by His Son. When Saul, of Tarsus,
was on his way to Damascus, to persecute the disciples
and followers of Christ, behold, at mid-day, a light,
<i>above the brightness of the Sun</i>, shone around him and
his band, and they all fell to the earth, and their leader
was smitten with blindness, which continued for
three days, and was only then relieved by the agencies
which the Saviour appointed. When first smitten, hearing
a voice that was not of Earth, he exclaimed, "Lord,
who art thou?" The answer was, "I am Jesus whom
thou persecutest."</p>

<p>When the beloved disciple John beheld the Son of
Man, walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks,
the light and influence was so overpowering, that he
"<i>fell at His feet as dead</i>." Thus we have a faint prelude
of the light of the glory of God. Yet no one in
mortality can behold it, even in a veiled form. But the
strength of the <i>spirit-eye</i> will enable us to behold the
King in all His glory, "for we shall see Him as
He is."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THAT HEAVENLY WORLD.</i></h2>


<p>We need not stand on Pisgah's height, nor climb
to the summit of the Andes, to catch a glimpse
of that "<span class="smcap">Heavenly world</span>." But, grasping
the telescope of <i>Faith</i>, and looking through <i>Revelations</i>,
the humblest Christian, "low down in the valley," may
see through the storm-clouds and tempests of life&mdash;yea,
even through the "shadow of death"&mdash;and gaze with
rapture upon the enchanting scene. The light of the
<i>Sun</i> pales without, as the flood-light of that <i>inner world</i>
breaks upon the eye. There is the resplendent "glory
of God," shining with unequalled radiance and beauty.
To the spirit-eye it is not blinding, neither will it even
dim the sight. Fear not, ye feeble followers of the
blessed Redeemer, to approach&mdash;even now&mdash;by faith
and contemplation, the confines of that bright world;
even though it is within that encircling photosphere of
<i>ethereal fire</i>. There is no danger, for by-and-by that
bright world will be your place of habitation. When
the winged messenger comes and escorts you away
from your earthly "prison-house," he will conduct you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to that bright world, where "an abundant entrance
shall be administered unto you" by your blessed
Saviour. Remember it is written in the "Sacred Volume":
"<i>The voice of God divideth the flame;</i>" and He
hath said: "<i>I will be as a wall of fire.</i>" "<i>When thou
goest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
shall the flames kindle upon thee.</i>" "<i>Enter thou into the
joys of thy Lord.</i>" No such flames within. "<i>The Sun
shall not light on thee; nor any heat;</i>" and yet there is
a resplendent light, even the "glory of God," which
illumines the Great City and all the vast realm. "<i>There
is no night there</i>," but one eternal day; and when thou
hast entered, "<i>The days of thy mourning shall be
ended.</i>"</p>

<p>But hold heavenward the telescope of <i>faith</i>; let us,
through the lights of revelation, endeavor to get a
slight panoramic view. The inspired poet caught a
glimpse before us. Hear him exclaim:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There, on those wide extended plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Shines one eternal day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There God the Son forever reigns,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And scatters night away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Behold! Spread out before us is the wide expanse
of a glorious universe. See in the distance those hills
and towering mountains; those beautiful valleys and
wide-extending plains. See the innumerable "set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
thrones," and, in the midst of all, "<span class="smcap">The Great White
Throne!</span>" and He who sits thereon is the <span class="smcap">Son of
God</span>, who reigns, and is the ruler of this vast empire.
See "before the throne a sea of glass like unto crystal,"
and around about the throne "four-and-twenty elders in
raiment of white, with crowns of gold," while all around
is "a rainbow, in sight like unto an emerald," or grand
<i>empyrean</i> covering resplendent with the light of the
"glory of God." See that fountain of the "river of
life" gushing from beneath the throne, and flowing on
and on, meandering amidst mountains and hills, and
through vast plains and beautiful valleys. See the
crystal fountains playing on every hand, and whose
waters are forever sparkling in the light of eternal day.
See the towering forest trees and shady "groves of
heaven," placed there by the "Word" of the Creator,
during past cycles of eternity, and long before time
commenced, their rich foliage presenting every variegated
hue, their boughs laden with all manner of precious
fruit suited for spiritual food, and their seasons
for bearing are now and forever. But see yonder, near
the base of that towering mountain,&mdash;whose summit
seems to mount up a thousand miles high, and whose
towering forests are waving in the gentle breezes of
heaven, and, with all things else, seem but to reflect
the light of the "glory of God;"&mdash;that vast plain
spreading out from its base is the "<span class="smcap">Garden of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Lord</span>." Its extent is even greater than that of our
whole Earth. It is filled with trees bearing fruits;
with shrubbery, and ten thousand times ten thousand
various and variegated flowers perennially blooming.
See the vast multitude of saints, attended by angels, as
they meander through its labyrinths, culling choicest
flowers, or lingering under "native bowers" or amid
shady groves. No old age or decrepitude; no gray
hairs to distinguish ages. The old seers and prophets;
neither are Adam nor Methuselah, who dwelt on the
earth nearly a thousand years, known here by age;
neither do our own aged fathers and mothers show
here any signs of decrepitude or advanced years, but,
even as their own children&mdash;our brothers, our sisters,
our husbands, our wives, and <i>our own children</i>, who have
found an inheritance here&mdash;all are as in the bloom of
youth and maturity, and will thus remain forever through
succeeding cycles of eternity. Ah! methinks, amid
that vast multitude you espy a father, a mother, a
sister, a brother, companion or child, or some dear,
loved friends from earth, who are now <i>radiant with
beauty</i> in that "Paradise of God," and that you would
fain drop mortality, and, on <i>spirit-wings</i> of love, go and
join them and be forever at rest. Wait, <i>not now</i>; but
if you have sought and found the "pearl of price," and
are abiding in the "<i>love of God</i>," you, too, will get there
by-and-by. Remember afflicted Job, who "knew his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
record was in heaven," yet with all this perceptive
knowledge, hear him meekly say: "<i>All my appointed
time will I wait, until my change cometh</i>," and "<i>though
He slay me, yet will I trust in Him</i>."</p>

<p>But while we have in hand the "telescope of faith"
and the revelations of God as our light, let us change
its direction a little, and add a new grasping power.</p>

<p>See! Behold the "City of God" of which "glorious
things were spoken,"&mdash;even the city of which John had
a panoramic view while "in the spirit" on the Isle of
Patmos. See its glittering "<i>jasper</i> walls" as they
loom up in the glory-light <i>fifteen hundred miles high</i>;
and whose foundations are <i>fifteen hundred miles square</i>,
covering a superficial extent of <i>two millions two hundred
and fifty thousand square miles</i>. See! "Its foundations
are garnished with all manner of precious
stones," and there are "twelve vast gates of entrance,
and the twelve gates are twelve pearls: every several
gate is one pearl." Those gates are now thrown wide
open, never to be shut again, for it is the "city of habitation"
for the redeemed from Earth, and hundreds
are arriving from our world every minute of time. See!
"its walls are of pure gold&mdash;even as jasper," while "its
streets are paved with gold transparent as glass." See
its vast arches, minarets and towers, and its palatial
mansions. Remember the blessed Saviour said, when
about to leave our Earth, "<i>In my Father's house are</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i>many mansions</i>;" and added, "<i>I go to prepare a place
for you, that where I am, there ye may be also</i>." Some
of our friends have homes in those beautiful mansions.
* * * * * It is enough. Our vision of these enchanting
scenes is ended, and we are left to contemplate
them in mind until our "appointed time" shall
come, and then if we are ready when our "Lord and
master calls," we, too, shall find a permanent home
with the "redeemed of the Lord" in that "<i>heavenly
world</i>," and then with St. Paul, we may see "the glory
which shall be revealed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE DIMENSIONS AND CAPACITY OF THE
CITY&mdash;THERE IS ROOM FOR ALL, AND TO
SPARE.</i></h2>

<p class="center">"<i>And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large
as the breadth; and he measured the city with a reed, twelve
thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the
height of it are equal.</i>" Rev. xxi.</p>


<p>Twelve thousand furlongs constitutes, by our
measurement, 1,500 miles. Thus we see that
the city lieth four-square, and its height is
equal to its length or breadth of foundation. The base
surface covers a superficial extent of 2,250,000 square
miles. The extent of the city will give us over 3,375,000,000
cubic miles. One cubic mile alone will afford
measurement of space for over 15,000,000 rooms 20
feet square, and the entire square of the city would
afford about 50,625,000,000,000,000 rooms of similar
dimensions.</p>

<p>But we are not justifiable in the belief other than
that it is a city of vast proportions, and one of grandeur
and beauty. We are told that it is a "city of
many mansions." Let us therefore contemplate it in
this light, and estimate that only <i>one-fiftieth</i> portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
its vast space is occupied by mansions; the balance
open space, streets, avenues, and courts. Such mansions
would thus afford over 1,000,000,000,000,000
rooms 20 feet square.</p>

<p>We will now compute the number of inhabitants
who have lived and died on the earth for 6,000 years
past; the number living on it at present, and estimate
how long of future time would be required to furnish
one soul to occupy each room. It is estimated that
there are at present 1,000,000,000, and that this number
die during each period of thirty years. Now if all
should find a home there, it would require more than
<i>thirty millions of years</i>, at the same ratio, to furnish
one soul for each room thus computed in those mansions.
And if we estimate that only <i>one-hundredth</i> part
of the space is occupied by mansions, it would even
then require 15,000,000 of years to thus people them.</p>

<p>But we are assured that the wicked shall not enter
there. That "wide is the gate, and broad is the way
that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which
go in thereat." We are therefore led to the inevitable
conclusion, that by far the larger number of those who
have lived and died on this earth, have failed to find
their home in that "city of which glorious things are
spoken."</p>

<p>Contemplating, as we have, the vast magnitude of
that city, we are justifiable in the conclusion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
there is ample provision of mansions there, as the
dwelling-place for other intelligences beside those from
this earth; probably the home and abode of the angels;
possibly, for inhabitants of the other planets belonging
to the same solar system with our own earth, as all
receive light and animation from the same sun, and all
are governed and controlled by the load-stone power
of attraction of that vast globe.</p>

<p>Again, may it not be that all that has been revealed
to us, is simply that which relates to <i>our</i> future habitation,
and that the city we have been contemplating is
for the abode of the righteous from this earth? May
there not be many other cities of equal, or even greater
magnitude within that vast empire&mdash;even one such
allotted to the inhabitants of <i>each separate planet</i>, and
that each may have a king and ruler provided by the
Creator of all? For all that we can comprehend of <i>our</i>
Saviour&mdash;who is to be our king and ruler&mdash;is, that he
came from God the Father to ransom the inhabitants
of this earth, and offer life and salvation to all who
should believe in Him "with a heart unto righteousness."
Remember, he said, "<i>In my Father's house
are many mansions.</i>" And added, "<i>I go to prepare a
place for</i> <small>YOU</small>, <i>that where I am there ye may be also.</i>"</p>

<p>The New Testament Scriptures teach the sublime
truth that the great interest of our blessed Saviour is
the salvation and happiness of those whom He denominates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
his children from this earth; those for whom He
died, and who shall believe in Him "unto everlasting
life." Hence, from all his teachings we believe this
suggested hypothesis correct. The Psalmist says, "<i>There
are set thrones of Judgment</i>," while the Apostles speak
of "<i>thrones and dominions; principalities and powers</i>."
There is ample room in that "Heaven" for all.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE NATIVE POPULATION OF THAT HEAVENLY
WORLD.</i></h2>

<p class="center">"The Angels of God."&mdash;Heb. 1. 6.</p>


<p>So far as revealed to us by record of the Bible,
the original or native inhabitants of Heaven
are called "Angels." These are also called
"messengers of God," and from all the lights we have,
it would seem that their principal occupation and
employment is to act as messengers; execute the
commands of Jehovah, and to worship, and magnify the
name of their Creator. Their perpetual residence, it
seems, is in Heaven, yet from the manifestations of
repeated visits to our earth, we can but suppose they
are God's messengers, oft sent to <i>other</i> worlds to do
His pleasure.</p>

<p>It would seem that they are possessed of intellectuality
next to Jehovah himself, yet all knowledge is
not given unto them. It also appears that there is a
vast difference in their grades and positions. We read
of Archangels, of Michael, and Gabriel, of the Sons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of God. They are sometimes called "Stars." Thus,
we read of "the morning stars which sang together."
We also read of Cherubim and Seraphim. And it may
be that some of the most exalted among them occupy
thrones, and have control of "dominions," "principalities,"
and "powers." We are told that "Michael and
<i>his</i> angels" fought the "Great Dragon and his angels."
Thus we see that they were the leaders, or had command
over many angels.</p>

<p>We are also justified in the belief that they are
princes and peers, and belong to the Court; possibly
form the ministerial cabinet, and are attendants in the
council chambers of heaven.</p>

<p>We have seen, through revelations, how oft&mdash;under
the earlier dispensation&mdash;they visited our earth, to bear
messages from God to the prophets, and to His people;
to warn or announce His threatenings, or execute His
commands in judgments upon the wicked. As angels
they are "<i>Spirits</i>," and as commissioned "ministers"
oft appeared as "<i>flames of fire</i>."</p>

<p>From the revelations made to us, we know they are
spiritual creatures of God, and that their nature is
<i>immaterial</i>, or that they have existence in highly <i>etherealized</i>
bodies, which can be transported at pleasure to
any remote or distant region of Jehovah's empire, with
a celerity surpassing&mdash;possibly&mdash;the flight of electricity
itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Angels, as "<i>spirits</i>," are immortal, and hence will
live forever. And thus also our own spirits must live
forever, because derived from the <i>spirit-life</i> of God.
Revelations furnish us abundant evidence of the <i>spirit</i>
nature of angels. They were oft present and speaking
with the prophets, and were yet <i>invisible</i>, as also within
doors where locks and bars precluded the possibility
of substance, or of earth-life animation entering. And
yet again, we have evidence of their appearing in tangible
form, and could be seen, and felt, and we read
of their being "entertained as men unawares." When,
however, they appeared as <i>angels</i>, we learn that their
bodily aspect was that of transcendent beauty; their
face and form resplendent with light, and a halo, as of
Divinity itself, shone around them.</p>

<p>It seems that angels have ever manifested a deep
and abiding interest in behalf of our Earth, and of man.
We are told that they celebrated the creation of this
world "with songs of praise and shouts of joy." At
the time of the birth of the Saviour, an angel from God
appeared to the shepherds, who were watching their
flocks by night, and announced the "glad tidings of
great joy, and immediately there appeared with the
angel, a multitude of the heavenly hosts" sounding loud
the anthem of praise, "Glory to God in the highest,
peace on Earth and good-will to men." How strange
this incident! The tongues of men were silent in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the hour of dawn of their redemption, and the angels
alone heralded the event, and sang the anthem of
praise. An angel subsequently warned Joseph to seek
a place of safety for the "Infant of days," as "Herod,
the King, would seek to destroy the young child's life."</p>

<p>During the Saviour's sojourn on Earth, how oft did
angels appear and minister unto Him; even "strengthening
Him," when His human nature staggered under
the load of the sins of a guilty world. And when&mdash;seemingly&mdash;the
"star of Bethlehem" had set, and the
hope of the world seemed lost; when the promised
Messiah was entombed; when dismay seized upon,
and thick darkness shrouded the minds of all who had
followed the Saviour; when even the Marys who loved
Him, repaired at early dawn to shed their tears at
His sepulchre: Behold! "<i>The angel of the Lord was
there</i>;" had "rolled away the stone and sat upon it."
He did not need to inquire their errand, but said unto
them: "I know it is Jesus whom ye seek, he is not
here, for He is risen." Oh, see what interest the angels
have ever manifested in our behalf! "<i>Are they
not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister unto those
who shall be the heirs of salvation?</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE VAST NUMBER OF THE ANGELS.</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>An innumerable company of angels.</i>" Heb. xii. 22.</p>


<p>Of the number of the angels we can form no proper
conception. That their numbers are very great, we have
evidence through Divine revelations. We are told that
when the Law was given from Mount Sinai, there was
in attendance upon the great Author of all "thousands
of angels." Daniel, speaking of their attendance upon
the "Ancient of Days" says, "thousand thousands
ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him." When the star appeared in
the "east," and led the wise men to Bethlehem where
lay the promised hope of a perishing world, there
appeared a multitude of the heavenly hosts, singing
with sweet melody the anthem of redemption, and
praises to God in the highest. When Peter unsheathed
his sword to smite the servant of the High Priest who
came to arrest his Master, the Saviour restrained him
and said: "<i>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my
Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve
legions of angels.</i>" While St. Paul speaks of an "innumerable
company of angels in the heavenly Jerusalem."</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<h2>AMAZING STRENGTH OF ANGELS.</h2>

<p class="center">"<i>Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength,
that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of
his word.</i>"&mdash;Ps. ciii. 20.</p>


<p>Of the amazing strength of angels, we can form no
adequate conception. "God is a Spirit," and by His
Spirit hath created all things. We have seen that His
angels are spirits, and that these spirits are <i>ethereal</i> in
their nature, so far as finite mind can comprehend.
And yet their strength is wonderful to contemplate.
St. John represents them as holding the four winds of
heaven, and controlling the elements with a supernatural
power. Commissioned by Jehovah for the purpose,
an angel destroyed seventy thousand people of the
tribes of Judah and Israel in three days. And again,
an angel destroyed, in one night, one hundred and
eighty-five thousand of a mighty army. It would seem
that by permission, or at command, they are capable
of exercising a power almost omnipotent. In the last
days, great power shall be given them. They shall
pour out the vials of Jehovah's wrath, smite earth and
seas, cause the stars to fall, and even <i>chain the great
dragon and cast him into the bottomless pit</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h2>RAPIDITY OF MOVEMENT OF THE ANGELS.</h2>


<p>We will now consider another feature of the capacity
of the angels, one that is fraught with deepest interest
to the human mind, as it will give us some light of
probabilities attending our future, when our spirits shall
be released from our mortal bodies. This is the celerity,
velocity, or rapidity of their movements.</p>

<p>These celestial creatures seem to possess the power
of transporting themselves with a celerity incomprehensible
to finite mind. That it is equal, even if not more
rapid than <i>electricity</i>, we cannot doubt. We incline to
the opinion, however, that the velocity of their movement
is, at pleasure, the same as that of the flight of
<i>electricity</i>; and so also with our spirits, after leaving
the body. No one can fully comprehend the <i>nature</i>
of electricity. We know that it exists, and to some
extent we can control and use it as an agency for
useful purposes; yet it is an existing element in nature,
even as fire is. We may concentrate and use it, and
we may profess to understand the combination of
agencies which produce it. Yet all resolves itself back
again into the simple fact that it is an <i>element existing
in nature</i>, and its source is that of all else&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Great
First Cause of all things</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Electricity is of more rapid flight than any other
element or agency we can&mdash;even partially&mdash;comprehend
in nature. If we had a wire laid around this
Earth, it is estimated that a current of <i>electricity</i> would
belt the globe in about the <i>tenth part</i> of a second of
time, or travel at nearly the speed of <i>three hundred
thousand miles</i> a second, and would reach the Sun&mdash;<i>ninety-five
millions of miles distant</i>&mdash;in a fraction over
<i>five minutes of time</i>. The discovery and application of
electricity is the most wonderful phenomenon that has
ever been grasped by the human intellect, and we contend
it is one of Jehovah's <i>invisible</i> agencies in nature,
which He has permitted man to comprehend in part,
and thus to prepare the mind to comprehend more
fully the infinity of His power, and the nature of our relation
to Him. Hitherto, even the mind of faith has
stood bewildered in regard to the transit of the soul,
after death, to the place of its future habitation. Astronomers,
by the aid of that wonderful gift of God to
man&mdash;the telescope&mdash;have penetrated the borders of
the far-distant sidereal regions; have caught rays of
light which, it is now rendered probable, left their native
nebulæ, or suns, more than <i>five hundred thousand
years</i> ago, and have travelled at the rate of 192,000 miles
a second ever since, and are now successively beaming
upon the assisted eye. Now, it would require more
than <i>three hundred thousand years</i> for a current of electricity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to travel thence, even at the rate of 300,000
miles each second of time. And yet, although far distant
regions have been penetrated and partially surveyed,
still, nowhere within the trackless and boundless
domain of illimitable space have Astronomers descried
an object which they could denominate "Heaven."
We say, considering all these circumstances, and that
it would require three hundred thousand years, travelling
with the rapidity of three hundred thousand miles
a second, to reach the extent of space surveyed by the
eye through the telescope, and yet the supposition that
heaven was still <i>far out beyond</i>; the mind of faith has
ever been bewildered as to the locality of the place,
and of the time, or period of eternity required to reach
it. And yet it was right and proper that Christians
should hold firm to faith in God; that He <i>had</i> provided a
place of happiness for his people, and also provided the
necessary agencies for transporting them thither. But
now, when we consider that every blessing vouchsafed
to man is derived from heaven, or the Sun&mdash;which is
God's agency&mdash;when we have contemplated the nature
of God's manifestations in the bestowment of his blessings,
and visitations of his judgments; when we see
how soon, at His bidding, His messengers can descend
from heaven to earth to execute His commands, and
the daily intimate relations in ancient times between
His angels residing in heaven, and His prophets and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
people on earth; how instantaneously they were present
when emergency demanded&mdash;for when "Daniel
bowed, and his prayer went up to heaven, the angel
Gabriel came with the answer from God while he was
still on his knees, and yet speaking,"&mdash;and accepting
the hypothesis we have laid, that our heaven is the vast
globe descried by Astronomers within that encircling
photosphere of ethereal fire, which is denominated the
"Sun," our veiled faith of the past takes a sudden
bound and lights upon&mdash;an almost <i>fully revealed reality</i>;
we can now partially comprehend the mode, and short
space of time required for the transit of our immortal
spirits to that heavenly world. It is reasonable to suppose
that spirit can pass with the velocity of electricity,
and travelling thus, we have seen that to reach that
world within the Sun, will require but about <i>five minutes</i>.
Well hath the apostle said, "to be absent from
the body, is to be present with the Lord."</p>

<p>There are fixed laws, and a certain <i>reality</i>, in all
things pertaining unto Jehovah and His vast creations
throughout His own Universe, and it is not unreasonable
to suppose that he has designed that we should
comprehend His laws relating to us, and thereby understand
His own plain revelations. We therefore believe
that reason, founded upon revelations, sustains
our hypothesis, as to the location of heaven&mdash;as also
of hell&mdash;and that the Spirit of God is&mdash;in some of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
offices&mdash;as <i>fire</i>. And we cannot doubt but that, henceforth,
these views will be sustained by the intelligence
of the world; and that still more of seeming mystery
will be comprehended, and new light opened to the
mind upon the subject, while all will tend to the glory
of God, and the salvation of the human family.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CERTAINTY OF A RESURRECTION.</i></h2>


<p>St. Paul, the apostle of the Gentiles, says:
"<i>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we
are of all men most miserable.</i>"</p>

<p>No wonder that he came to such conclusion, when
he knew that kings, rulers, and the populace were
overwhelmingly against the few disciples and followers
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that persecutions, bonds,
imprisonment, and even violent death were in store for
many of them.</p>

<p>But hear him again:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
from the dead. The last enemy that shall be destroyed
is death.</p>

<p>"Now I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God. Behold, I show you a mystery;
we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment,
in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump; for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible,
and we shall be changed. For this corruption must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
Death shall be swallowed up in victory. Thanks be
to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ."</p></blockquote>

<p>That there will be a resurrection of our spiritual
bodies, is plainly taught in the Old and in the New
Testament scriptures. We have already shown this
conclusively in our opening chapter on "The Immortality
of the Soul, and a future State of Existence."
But had doubts remained in the minds of any, we think
St. Paul&mdash;as quoted above&mdash;removes them, and sets
the matter at rest.</p>

<p>St. John, the revelator, tells us that while in the
spirit, the scene of the judgment was brought before his
vision. He says:</p>

<blockquote><p>"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
God, and the books were opened, and the dead were judged
out of those things which were written in the books, according
to their works."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now we understand that this general judgment will
be at the close of the time allotted to this world.
Whether that period is far remote or near at hand, no
one knoweth save God himself; "no, not even the
angels of heaven." But as to that time, it matters not,
so far as salvation and a condition of happiness to the
righteous is concerned, nor to the wicked, as regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
future punishment. Revelations and the Word of God
establish the fact that as soon as the soul, or spirit
leaves the body, it enters upon its future and final condition,
whether of happiness or misery, "Lazarus died,
and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom.
The rich man also died and was buried, and in hell he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment." The Saviour,
while suspended upon the cross, manifested His pardoning
and saving power to the thief, forgave his sins,
accepted him, and said: "To-day shalt thou be with
me in Paradise."</p>

<p>Under the circumstances&mdash;the extreme sufferings
and agonies the Saviour was enduring at the time&mdash;some
have cavilled at this exhibition of grace and pardoning
mercy to the dying thief. Let it be remembered,
His mission was to save sinners. And that it is
written, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shalt be saved."</p>

<p>Here is a plain exhibition of the possibility, and plan
of salvation to <i>all</i>. This thief had sinned; and had
also violated the laws of his country, and in rebuking
his fellow culprit in crime&mdash;who had reviled the Saviour&mdash;he
acknowledged his own guilt by saying, "this man
suffereth innocently; yet we are guilty, and justly deserve
our punishment." Indeed, he seemed to be the
<i>first</i> to comprehend Christ's kingdom, and the plan of
salvation through faith in Him. By faith, he grasped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the hope, then springing from the Cross whereon the
Saviour hung, and penitently cried unto the Redeemer
of the world, "Lord, remember me when Thou comest
into Thy kingdom." See this flash of light in the
midst of spiritual darkness, dismay, and surrounding
gloom&mdash;even the light of immortality and eternal life!
All the followers had forsaken the dying Redeemer,
and those who had been his acknowledged disciples
were fleeing in dismay, and even Peter denied his Lord
and Master with an oath. The hope of the world's
deliverance; through the Messiah, seemed lost. Yet
here was one&mdash;even a poor dying thief&mdash;whose faith
penetrated the veil, and <i>he</i> saw that Christ's kingdom
was not of this world. He believed on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and the promise made to all who believe in
Him; with a heart unto righteousness, was vouchsafed
to him. We look upon this as the strongest exhibition
of faith the world had ever yet known. And we think
the evidence conclusive, that as soon as the soul leaves
the body&mdash;this tenement of clay&mdash;it enters at once upon
its future condition of happiness, or of misery.</p>

<p>Of the certainty of the final resurrection of our
bodies&mdash;changed and transformed into spiritual bodies&mdash;and
of a general judgment, the Scripture revelations
are plain and conclusive. May we not therefore, for a
few moments, contemplate the eventful, and, to some,
the pleasant, yet to others the startling scene?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>That the bodies of some who lived on this earth
have already undergone this great, and to us mysterious
change of "corruption putting on incorruption,"
and "mortal putting on immortality," we cannot doubt.
This seems manifest in the case of Elijah, and so also,
as seems evident, with Moses. And it will be remembered
that these two appeared in their heavenly vestments;
bright and shining, and stood with the Saviour
when he was transfigured on the Mount. So also at
the time of the crucifixion of the Son of God. When,
at the last moment of his expiring agony he cried to
his Father, with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost;
the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent, and the
graves were opened, "and many bodies of the Saints
that slept arose." And to make this&mdash;seeming mystery&mdash;more
clear to those He had commissioned to preach
His everlasting gospel&mdash;the power of which should be
the resurrection from the dead&mdash;the Saviour himself,
after His body had risen from the grave, appeared unto
them&mdash;His disciples&mdash;and thus gave them a <i>visible
manifestation</i> of this wondrous truth, and re-commissioned
them to go forth into all the world and proclaim
<i>his own resurrection</i>, and that by repentance and faith
all might come to a <i>resurrection of life</i>.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE RESURRECTION.</i></h2>


<p>Therefore, behold, the time cometh when
"all that are in their graves, shall hear His
voice"&mdash;even the voice of God&mdash;and the angel
shall sound the trumpet, and its tones of melody and
the voice of love will move earth and seas, from centre to
circumference, and awake into immortal life the decayed
bodies and mouldering dust of His sleeping children.
"For the dead in Christ shall rise first," and "blessed are
they who have part in the first resurrection, for on such
the second death hath no power." "They shall have
a right to the tree of life." See the myriads of sepulchres
and graves opening, and saints rising in the
light of the "glory of God," and millions of the sheeted
dead&mdash;who have slept beneath the bosom of "deep
blue seas;" in the depths of oceans, or were swept away
by floods and flowing rivers&mdash;rising and riding in triumph
upon the swelling, bright-crested waves which
sparkle in the resplendent glory-light of heaven.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></div></div>

<p>These come forth at their Creator's call, and now at
His bidding, the happy reunion of the long separated
partners&mdash;souls and bodies&mdash;takes place, and the vast
realm resounds with shouts of triumph and songs of
praise. While the "<i>Morning Stars</i>" who sang the <i>pean</i>
of Creation, and the angelic host&mdash;who celebrated in
the hill-country of Judea, the advent of the Saviour on
earth to ransom fallen man&mdash;join in melody and again
swell the loud anthem, "<span class="smcap">glory to God in the highest!</span>"
Then shall be repeated the saying which was
written, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?" "Thanks be to God who giveth
us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
And, ascending again with their resurrected glorified
bodies, the voice of the archangel Gabriel&mdash;who sounded
their resurrection trumpet&mdash;will be heard from the
portal of heaven, throughout the vast domain. BEHOLD
THEY COME!</p>

<p>We would fain close this chapter with these delightful
reflections, and leave the minds of all free from
fearful apprehensions, and happy in the contemplation
of a future resurrection to the enjoyment of a blissful
immortality and eternal life. But the Laws of God are
stern and inflexible in their requirements; His judgments
sure; His revelations plain, and all are in duty
bound to contemplate them.</p>

<p>We have told you that at His <i>call</i> "the righteous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
shall come forth to a resurrection of life." And now
we have to record the fact that&mdash;at His <i>command</i>&mdash;"the
wicked shall come forth to a resurrection of damnation."
To contemplate or depict the scene startles
the mind, and baffles and beggars the human intellect.</p>

<p>We fancy a death-like silence prevails throughout
the earth and seas, and the vast domain of Heaven.
Songs of triumph, and shouts of joy, of both saints and
angels, have ceased for one hour of eternity. The
Judge ascends His throne, from which to issue His
command. The four and twenty Elders remove their
glittering crowns of gold, and bow before Him. Moses
and Elijah, and all the prophets, apostles, and martyrs
are there. There the redeemed of the Lord&mdash;whom
no man can number&mdash;are assembled with legions of
angels. All bow before the Lord, and "there is silence
in Heaven." Hark! the command was given! The
voice of the final judgment-trumpet; in thunder tones,
waxes louder and louder! and seems to shake heaven
itself, with its surrounding universe of worlds. It is
the trumpet-voice of the "WRATH OF GOD" summoning
the wicked of a sin-cursed world, to arise and
come to judgment.</p>

<p>See! the Earth is convulsed from the centre to its
circumference, and is "rocking to and fro, as a drunken
man." Graves are opening on every hand, and from all
the Earth, from deep dark seas and oceans' depths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
behold the pale, <i>ghastly</i> multitudes coming forth, filled
with terror and dismay. Mountains are sinking, and
valleys rising, like surgings of contending billows; and
their rocky foundations, though ten thousand feet
deep, are breaking into fragments! A tempest of God's
fiery indignation is smiting the Earth! Hear the muttering
thunders of the judgment storm! see the dread
lightnings flashing amidst the surrounding gloom! The
internal magazine-fires of the Earth are belching forth
their molten lava, which is lifting the deep foundations
of seas and oceans into mountain-peaks, and rolling
<i>fiery billows</i>. See! behold! the Universal conflagration
of the world! seas, oceans, and all the Earth, one
vast sheet of <i>flame</i>. While the angel (which John saw)
"<i>standing in the Sun</i>" calls in thunder tones, ARISE
YE DEAD AND COME TO JUDGMENT! And
then swears by Him, that liveth forever and ever, "<span class="smcap">Time
shall be no longer</span>."</p>

<p>The unnumbered millions of resurrected bodies of
the wicked would fain refuse a reunion with their long
lost souls, and fall back and be consumed or annihilated
by the raging elements. But now, for the wicked
there is no place of safety. They refused the refuge
once freely offered them in the "cleft side of the Redeemer,"
and trifled away their days of grace, and now
the stern reality of the threatened judgment is upon
them. Their souls, perhaps, have already suffered for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
thousands of years in fiery torments, and now death
and hell give up their dead to a reunion, that all may
receive their final sentence from the "Judge of quick
and dead" to depart and "dwell in everlasting burnings."</p>

<p>In their direful extremity they would fain "flee
from the presence of God." Hear them calling upon
the fiery whirlwind-tempest of rocks, and moving
mountains "to fall on them, and hide them from the
face of Him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the
wrath of the Lamb," and crying aloud, "<span class="smcap">Behold! the
great day of His wrath has come; who shall be
able to stand?</span>" Yet these fragments of a convulsed
and dismembered universe are restrained from performing
such office of mercy, and by the Word&mdash;which
created them&mdash;are hurled back into the raging chaotic
storm, to "melt with fervent heat" and mingle with
the elements in the convulsive throes of a <i>wrecked
world</i>, which is being consumed by the <span class="smcap">"spirit-fires"
of Jehovah's wrath</span>.</p>

<blockquote><p>"And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and
death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them;
and I saw the dead small and great stand before God, and
they were judged according to their works. And death and
hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second
death. And whosoever was not found written in the book
of life, was cast into the lake of fire; and the same shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out
without mixture into the cup of His indignation. And I
saw an angel standing in the Sun. And the fourth angel
poured out his vial upon the Sun, and power was given unto
him to scorch men with fire; and men were scorched with
great heat. And they shall be tormented with fire and
brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the
presence of the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment ascendeth
up forever and ever."</p></blockquote>

<h2><i>A SERIOUS CONTEMPLATION.</i></h2>


<p>The contemplation of the final judgment, and
the sentence to be passed upon the wicked, is
truly a solemn one, and should startle every
mind, But oh, how few, comparatively, seem to stop and
reflect upon this momentous subject? And yet <i>all</i> are
rapidly hastening on to their final doom. Few are
aware of the vast numbers that are passing from time
into eternity&mdash;even each year, each month, each day
each hour, or each minute.</p>

<p>We will here state the numbers, as well ascertained,
or approximated, by the ablest staticians of the world.
They tell us there is one death for every second of time,
60 every minute; 3,600 every hour; 84,400 every day;
2,595,000 every month; 31,140,000 every year, and a
number equal to the entire population of the globe,
<i>viz.</i>: <i>one thousand millions</i> every thirty years. And we
are forced to the conclusion, that by far the larger portion
of adults pass away without any conscious knowledge
of the plan of salvation, or a tenable hope of
heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Reader, stop and reflect. No matter what your
age, your condition of health, or in life, you, too, must
soon know the realities of your future; your eternal
state of existence.</p>

<p>We have heard the remark from the ungodly, that
if they failed to reach heaven, they would, at least, "be
with a large crowd." Yes, we have no doubt of it.
For we read of "legions of devils," and there will also
be legions from <i>earth</i> to be tormented by them. Now
we appeal to the reason of every intelligent mind, can
you expect to enjoy happiness in your eternal existence,
amid devouring flames?</p>

<p>We learn that devils are fallen angels. Once they
enjoyed happiness in that heavenly world, and were,
doubtless, God's messengers; oft sent to different regions
of His empire to do His pleasure. Yet viewing
the grandeur and glory of God, it appears that the great
Dragon&mdash;who had the control of many angels&mdash;enlisted
them to sustain him in some unlawful usurpation. This
was resisted by Michael and his angels, "and there
was war in heaven." Michael and his angels prevailed,
and the great Dragon, "that old serpent called the
devil, and satan, was cast out, and his angels were cast
out with him;" "neither was their place found any more
in heaven." These, we learn, are the wicked spirits,
which go to and fro, up and down, through the earth,
tempting man to sin, and to do wickedly. Satan is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
prince of the powers of darkness, and he and his
minions are ever arrayed against the prince of life and
salvation. And man as a free moral agent&mdash;having life
and death set before him&mdash;is left the free choice as to
whom he will serve. If your choice be the God who
created all things by the word of His power, and whose
glory is the light of eternal day, serve Him. But if
Baal, the prince of darkness, whose reign is terror and
death, then serve him. "Ye cannot serve two masters
at once."</p>

<p>Remember! When death shall come and claim you
for its victim, with the cessation of mortal life, there is
cessation of all the sensations and faculties of your
<i>human nature</i>. You will not be moved upon to the
enjoyment of pleasure by human passions or desires.
These, as realized here, will forever cease, and the
spirit can no more be controlled by flesh and blood,
nor by human desires. Yet that immortal principle&mdash;the
soul&mdash;will be susceptible of ineffable happiness, or
of intense misery. Will it be any comfort or pleasure
to you to know that others are, like yourself, doomed
to suffer eternal torments? to witness their agonies, and
hear their wailings in that pandemonium of the lost?
Think for a moment, of the rich man&mdash;Dives&mdash;who
realized those torments. No hope for him in the future;
his day of probation had passed; his eternal state was
fixed; yet he prayed Father Abraham to send Lazarus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
back to this world, to warn his five brethren, lest they
also should come to that place of torment. Remember,
that as death leaves the body, so judgment finds the
soul, for the prophet has warned you that,</p>

<blockquote><p>"There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom
in the grave whither thou goest."</p></blockquote>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>THE FINAL JUDGMENT.</i></h2>


<p>"<i>The Lord shall endure forever, he hath prepared
his throne for judgment." "We shall
all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ."
"Then every one of us shall give an account of himself to
God."</i></p>

<p><i>"And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before
God; and the books were opened, * * * and the dead
were judged out of those things which were written in the
books, according to their works."</i></p>

<p><i>"Then shall the king say unto them on his right hand:
Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world;" * * *
"an entrance shall be administered unto you abundantly;"
* * * "enter ye in through the gates into the city;" * * *
"enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."</i></p>

<p><i>"Then shall he say also unto them on his left hand:
Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels." "These shall go into everlasting
punishment, but the righteous into life eternal."</i></p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>A HOME IN HEAVEN.</i></h2>


<p>Our pilgrimage on earth is one of unrest, is one
of toil, sorrow, and affliction. Here we have
no abiding place, "no continuing city." Our
"days on earth are few, and are full of trouble." There
is no permanency here. From the time of the first infant
breath and short unconscious slumber on a mother's
bosom to the latest hour and moment of life, we are
ever restless and moving onward, and endure all the
disquietude and sufferings of mind and body incident
to our mortal existence. The original sin of our first
parents, blighted all hope of permanence or enduring
happiness on this earth. At the time of their fall, God
pronounced as to our existence here, saying: "Cursed
is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of
it all the days of thy life; thorns and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread till thou return to the ground; for out of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
wast thou taken: dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou
return." "And the spirit shall return to God who
gave it."</p>

<p>Yet to the true and faithful followers of the blessed
Redeemer&mdash;who ransomed the world by the pouring
out of His own blood, and opened up a way whereby
we may escape the further penalties of a violated law&mdash;rest
will come by-and-by. "There is rest for the
weary," and mansions prepared for them in the "City
of God," in that better world. Remember, the Saviour
said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I go to prepare a place for you, that where I am there
ye may also be. To him that overcometh will I give to eat
of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of
God. The same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I
will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will
confess his name before my Father and before his angels.
He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be
his God, and he shall be my son." "<span class="smcap">Whosoever will,
let him come.</span>" "I will give unto him that is athirst of
the fountain of the <i>water of life</i> freely." "<span class="smcap">They shall
live for ever and ever.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>There the redeemed of the Lord shall, with their
blessed Saviour, "inherit the kingdom," where the
glory of God illumines the "city," and throws its
radiance over all the vast realm. O what a delightful
place for a permanent "<i>Home!</i>" How singularly different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it contrasts with our residence on earth. Here
we have to endure toil, pain, and death; there, rest,
happiness, and eternal life. See here the care-worn,
weary husband, toiling and striving against contending
billows and waves of misfortune, to earn a support for
a helpless, dependent family; perhaps his strivings are
the more difficult because of pain of body or anguish
of mind. Disease in some form may be preying upon
his vitality, even through long years of existence, and
he knows that it will eventually conquer, and consign
him to his grave. Or, if bodily health prevails, the
mind may be tortured and distracted at witnessing the
sufferings of a beloved wife, or children, as one by one
they are smitten down or snatched away by death; or
still more poignant the grief and anguish he endures
because of the alienation of affections, or family tumults,
of strifes and contentions. See that wife and mother
lingering by the bedside of a devoted, yet now dying
husband, or clasping to her tortured and heaving bosom
the lifeless form of a beloved child, and yet powerless
to save the one or call back the other. These are the
heart-strugglings in the tempest of life. Soon they will
be over. A few years more, at most, and then all will
be still; this mortality will be silent in the grave.</p>

<p>But of that "home in heaven." "Glorious things
are spoken of thee, O City of God." There love, peace,
and joy forever reigns. There is the "full fruition"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and realization of "the hope of the glory of God."
There "their lines have fallen to them in pleasant
places." There they realize "fulness of joy," and their
heritage "pleasures for evermore." There they find
"that inheritance which is incorruptible, undefiled, and
that fadeth not away." There they have a home in an
enduring city, whose foundations are eternal. There
the palms of victory; and crowns of glory. There they
walk the gold-paved streets of the city, or wander at
pleasure in the 'Garden of the Lord,' or amidst forests
green, or pleasant groves. There the crystal fountains
play their sparkling waters in the light of eternal day,
and the "river of life" flows "from beneath the throne
of God," onward and onward, meandering through, and
encircling the vast realm of that heavenly empire.
There perennial spring, and never-fading flowers.
There old age and decrepitude are never known, but
all clothed upon with "garments of righteousness," will
live and dwell in perpetual immortal youth, through the
ever-recurring cycles of endless eternity. Angels of
God are there. The Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs
are there; ministers of God are there; some of our
kindred friends are there; others of them will <i>soon</i> be
there. The redeemed of earth, who were accepted of
the Lord are there, and the remainder of the "ransomed
hosts," are now pressing on, or coming after, and <i>will
all be there</i>, and form an innumerable company which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
no one can number, each can form pleasant associations
there, never to be broken up, "For nothing shall
disturb in all the holy mountains." Reader, are you
striving for that <small>HAPPY HOME</small>?</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<h2><i>CONCLUSIVE AND CONCLUDING ARGUMENT.</i></h2>


<p>The Sun is held by all Philosophers and Astronomers
to be the central pivot of the solar
system, and the <i>loadstone power of attraction</i>,
which governs, steadies, and controls all its surrounding
planet-worlds in their orbits. So great is its power
of attraction, that a counter-balancing force was necessary
to keep the machinery of Nature in order. This
force is produced by the attracting power of the various
planet-worlds, placed in proper positions in surrounding
space, and thus furnishing the <i>centrifugal</i>, to
counterbalance the <i>centripetal</i> force <i>ascribed</i> to the Sun,
by which means our earth, and the other planets, are
kept whirling in their elliptical orbits, and thus each
prevented from being drawn by the superior centripetal
or attracting power of that globe into certain destruction
by the fires of the <i>Sun</i>.</p>

<p>This is the hypothesis, we believe, of every Philosopher
and Astronomer of the present day.</p>

<p>Now let us examine this hypothesis, and see if it
does not foreshadow and sustain our own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>In the first place, it is <i>true</i> that the <i>"loadstone
power of attraction" is there</i>: but it is <i>within</i> what all
denominate the <span class="smcap">Sun</span>, and by <i>this</i> the surrounding planets
are controlled. But this power <i>is not the Sun</i>. For
what all denominate the Sun, is that which gives out
light and heat. The Sun is <i>fire</i>, <i>heat</i>, and <i>brightness</i> or
light. Fire, or heat, is <i>ethereal</i>; has no such power of
attraction: but on the contrary, is repelling and dissipating.
There is no solid substance in fire; it is an
invisible agency&mdash;save when it is concentrated. It
would be an unreasonable hypothesis to conclude that
the fires of the Sun were fed on combustible material.
The Sun may have been just the same as it is now, for
untold <i>billions of years</i>&mdash;possibly from all eternity&mdash;and
God, by His Word has revealed the fact that it will
continue forever&mdash;even as long as His throne. Hence,
if produced by combustion, its material would be constantly
wasting away, and, as Prof. Olmsted says, "the
products of combustion would obscure its light."
Therefore, as there is no tangible source, and all agree
that God Himself was, and still is its source, we hold
that our hypothesis, that it is a fixed volume of <i>Photospheric-ethereal</i>,
or <i>spirit-fire</i>, is correct. That it is one
of Jehovah's attributes; ever existing and performing
its offices in creative and enduring Nature; never increasing
nor diminishing.</p>

<p>Now, this being the only reasonable, and&mdash;as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
believe&mdash;correct hypothesis, of the origin, nature, and
element of the <i>Sun</i>&mdash;the Sun being the brightness we
see in looking at it&mdash;<i>where</i> and <i>what is the loadstone
power of attraction</i>, which reaches out millions of miles
into space, and controls vast worlds, steadying each in
its own orbital path, while they are flying round at the
rate of from fifty thousand, to one hundred thousand
miles an hour? We think the answer plain, and that
all can comprehend it. This Earth is a solid body,
and <i>all such</i> possess, within themselves, the power of
attraction. Therefore, the laws of Nature reveal the
fact to us, that <i>the great central and controlling power
of attraction</i> attributed to the <i>Sun</i>, is the vast <span class="smcap">Inner
Globe</span> we have been contemplating; a globe, or
world, more than a million times the size of this
Earth. Leading Astronomers have agreed on the existence
of such a body within; and far separated&mdash;by
a non-luminous atmosphere or void&mdash;from the outer
<i>photosphere of ethereal fire</i>. That globe we hold is&mdash;<i>beyond
a doubt</i>&mdash;the "HEAVENLY WORLD" spoken
of throughout the Holy Scriptures, and is the final and
eternal home of the righteous.</p>

<p>We see wisdom displayed, and find law and order
in every thing we comprehend which pertains to God
and Nature. Phenomena, which for long ages were
mysteries, are now, through the lights of science, being
fully comprehended and made plain to all. And, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
reasoning from analogy, new arts and sciences are
comprehended, while each additional light gained
flashes upon some other hidden mystery, and reveals
in it nothing but <i>law</i> and <i>order</i>, in all its arrangements.</p>

<p>The progress made of late in the arts and sciences
is wonderful indeed; yet this is only the progress of the
mind of man, and the enlightenment of his intellect.
And we believe that the next decade of years will develop
<i>facts</i> which might startle the minds of the wisest
of to-day to contemplate.</p>

<p>That vast world&mdash;surrounded by the Sun&mdash;controls
this Earth and its other surrounding planets. From
that world, and Sun&mdash;in its offices&mdash;we derive every
blessing while on Earth, and we cannot doubt but that
when we find our future, <small>IT WILL BE THERE</small>. The
righteous to dwell <i>within</i> where, we have shown you,
the Sun does not or cannot shine; but where the
<i>glory of God</i> is the light of the holy place, and yet we
have the evidence that one of the offices of the <i>Sun</i>
will be the punishment of the wicked who cannot enter
that <span class="smcap">Heavenly World</span>.</p>

<p>"<i>Whoso is wise will observe these things.</i>" Psalms, cvii.</p>

<h2><i>WILL ALL TAKE HEED?</i></h2>


<p class="center">* &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * </p>
<p>Gentle reader, we are about to take our
leave of you. We have penned the lines
which compose this volume at short intervals
obtained recently from a laborious professional life.
Our mind has been duly impressed with the correctness
of the views we have advanced. Indeed, to disbelieve
them, would seem to disbelieve Divine revelations,
and let the mind become again shrouded with impenetrable
mystery in regard to the place of our future habitation,
and of the manner and mode of the spirit's
transit thither after the death of the body. All should
remember that they will be held accountable for the
light and knowledge they receive.</p>

<p>We feel fully assured that our hypothesis as to the
location of Heaven&mdash;as also that of Hell&mdash;is well
founded and fully sustained by God's own revelations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
both as recorded in the Bible, and as seen in visible
nature. As to the "Spirit of God as fire," we have
presented such evidence as Divine revelations have
furnished us, and only added to these such as <i>reason</i>,
as the perceptive faculties of all, do or may comprehend,
and we do not see wherein the <i>Christian World</i>
can found any objections to our conclusions.</p>

<p>That there might be culled from the Bible a few
passages which may seem not to reflect our views is
natural, when we consider how it is interspersed with
the views and versions of various historical writers in
the chronicling of events. But we believe Divine revelations
furnish sufficient <i>positive evidence</i> to sustain us;
such evidence as the <i>reason</i> of every enlightened and
reflecting mind will comprehend and approve. We
believe this knowledge should&mdash;nay, doubtless, <i>will</i>&mdash;have
a salutary and beneficial effect upon the minds
and hearts of all. We now leave all as a <i>personal
matter with you</i>. That you <i>will have a future</i> you cannot
doubt. We therefore beseech you to remember
"that God will not be mocked" with impunity; neither
can he be deceived.</p>

<p>"<i>For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<i>reap. He that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reap
corruption; but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the
spirit reap life everlasting.</i>"</p>

<p>Hear the Preacher of God (Eccl. xii. 13, 14):</p>

<p>"<i>Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear
God and keep His commandments; for this is the whole
duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment,
with every secret thing, whether it be good, or
whether it be evil.</i>"</p>

<h2>APPEAL<br />

TO<br />

CHRISTIAN MINISTERS.</h2>


<p>It might reasonably be expected that as we
have advanced a new hypothesis as to the location
of <i>Heaven</i>, and also of <i>Hell</i>, that we should
also give our views as to what we deem the correct faith
and principles of the <i>true Christian Religion</i>. You will
see in our "<i>Preface</i>" that we have not designed to
make our book sectarian in behalf of any one of the
different Protestant organizations. And, not being a
minister of the Gospel, we leave the great and important
work of thus directing the mind to those whose
rightful mission it is to instruct. True, our views upon
this subject are foreshadowed in these pages, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
believe the time has now come when there should be a
<i>general review</i> by all leading Divines. That they should
take under consideration all new lights afforded by the
sciences&mdash;especially the science of Astronomy&mdash;and
bring these to bear with philosophical reason upon
Divine Revelations and Bible truths; and thereby
comprehend more fully the nature of God, and his requirements
of man in order to salvation. We think
that by such action on their part, that most, even if not
all of the minor sectarian differences of opinion can be
removed, and that all can unite as one great Family
of the Church of God on Earth; and that mysteries
which have hitherto shrouded the minds of the masses&mdash;as
to the necessary faith and practice in a true religion&mdash;may
thereby be removed, and all the world of
mankind be brought to a saving knowledge of the truth,
and "know the Lord, whom to know aright is Eternal
Life."</p>

<p>We know that, at first thought, this may seem to be
a great undertaking; and, however desirable, some
may entertain doubts as to its accomplishment, and
therefore hesitate to move in the matter; yet we believe
that it can, and, sooner or later, will be accomplished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and that the final results will prove worthy the
life efforts of every Christian minister on this Earth.</p>

<p>Neither ministers, their flocks, nor the entire human
family now on the Earth, have long to live, nor
time to delay in this great matter. One decade of <i>ten</i>
short years, and about <i>one third of all now living</i> will
have passed away, while <i>thirty years</i> will close the
drama of life with <i>one thousand millions</i>, or most of the
present inhabitants of this globe, and all must find
their future state of existence. Many of us can look
back over thirty years past, and realize that the time
has been <i>short</i>. So, also, will be the few remaining
years allotted to any of us. Therefore, it becomes all
to heed well the warning voice of Him who hath said:</p>

<p>"<i>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.</i>"</p>

<p>All the different church organizations <i>cannot be
right</i> in their present faith and practice, however lenient
they may profess to be toward each other, or even
<i>hope</i> that such is the case. This were impossible. God
has designed to establish <i>one true universal Church</i> on
this Earth, and <span class="smcap">He will do it</span>, though it should sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
away every such organization now in existence, and
even obliterate their every land-mark. We do not say
that there is not now in each, more or less, of the germ
of <i>truth</i>, nor that from these scattered fragments may
not yet be gathered that which shall constitute the
body and life of the whole. There may be a struggle
first with the powers of darkness, yet this <span class="smcap">Great
Church will be established and prevail</span>.</p>

<p>The lights of true science, which are revealing
more fully God's own revelations, we believe, will <i>force</i>
a change to a more <i>universal system of religion</i>. The
mind will comprehend more of the Great Jehovah, and
of His will and plan of salvation. Therefore, we believe
it to be the duty of all Christian ministers to
move in this matter. They should investigate and
comprehend all the new lights afforded them, and thereby
be enabled to make plain the revelations of God;
remove all mystery; establish His Eternal Truth, and
teach all minds and hearts to "look up through Nature
to Nature's God."</p>

<p>This will not be the work of only a day, or a week,
nor yet of any one individual; but the work of <i>time</i>,
with the <i>united efforts</i> of leading minds of the age, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
we hope that its commencement will not long be delayed.</p>

<p>It must be acknowledged that the <i>plans</i> of salvation,
as now taught by the many different Protestant Church
organizations, are all, more or less, mystery to the outside
world. Hence, <i>Infidelity</i> has in this highly colored
reasons&mdash;at least to sustain their assertions against
the <i>truth</i> of the <i>Christian religion</i>, and so also have the
<span class="smcap">Jews</span>. This fact no one can reasonably deny. The
mind of man&mdash;his thinking, <i>reasoning</i> faculty&mdash;must be
convinced by evidence before he can be brought to believe,
and in this great and important matter he <i>must
believe</i> before he will act.</p>

<p>The <i>Mind</i> must be left free and <i>untrammelled</i>, and
governed only by <i>enlightened reason</i>. This should be
the course pursued by all teaching ministers. <span class="smcap">Light</span>,
<span class="smcap">Liberty</span>, and <span class="smcap">Eternal Life</span> should be the watchwords
of those who stand upon the "Walls of Zion!"
The mind must be taught to <i>love</i> God in all His Immaculate
perfections, and to serve Him through that love
which "<i>casteth out all fear</i>." St. Paul says, "<i>God hath
not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of</i> <small>LOVE</small>
<i>and of a sound mind.</i>" John tells us, "<i>There is no fear</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<i>in love; but perfect love casteth out all fear; because fear
hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</i>"
And yet in <small>PERFECT LOVE</small>, we shall <i>always</i> have the
"fear of God before our eyes;" we shall ever fear to
offend Him, and thereby fulfil every commandment
given us <i>to</i> fear Him. But "<span class="smcap">he that dwelleth in
God, dwelleth in love</span>."</p>

<p>We believe that if the Christian ministry throughout
would properly present the claims of God to the
<i>love</i> of the human heart, there would soon be a turning
of the masses to Him, such as has never been witnessed
since the beginning of the world.</p>

<p>That by the teachings of so many different creeds,
their widely different faith and doctrines, the mind of
man in general has become bewildered; and that mystery,
deep, dark, almost impenetrable, hangs&mdash;more or
less&mdash;over all, we cannot deny. See the numerous different
Church organizations, founded and presided over
by men of intellect and learning; each claiming to be
established by <i>Scriptural authority!</i> and yet in their
faith and teachings, all conflicting, more or less, with
each other. We cannot doubt the honesty and sincerity
of these ministers, nor of their church members; yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
may not many of them be "blind leaders of the blind?"
To each of these, all other organizations, faith, and doctrine
seem a mystery; and if a mystery to those who
are striving after light and truth in the way of life and
salvation, is it not far more of mystery to those outside,
who have not been educated into any system of
religious belief? The truth is, <i>enlightened reason</i> condemns
this exhibition as the "Church of God," for it has
become "a stumbling block" in the road to truth and
the way of salvation. When we go to the founders
and leaders of these different organizations, and ask,
why all these conflicting elements? the majority of them
will answer, remember that Christ hath said, "I am the
vine, ye are the branches," and add a garbled quotation
from the writings of St. Paul, "<i>Great is the mystery
of godliness</i>."</p>

<p>Now there is but one <i>true vine</i>, and all its branches
will bring forth the same "good fruits of righteousness"
by which all shall be known. And as to <i>mystery</i>,
let us see what the great apostle of the Gentiles
did say.</p>

<p>"<i>And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness;
God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<i>Spirit, seen of angels; preached unto the Gentiles, believed
on in the world, and received up into glory.</i>"</p>

<p>There we have all of it, and, taken together, it explains
itself to every intelligent mind, and thus, properly
comprehended, removes <i>all mystery</i>, and implies
the necessary faith and plan of salvation.</p>


<p class="center"><big>FORESHADOWINGS.</big></p>

<p>The "signs of the times" are pregnant with coming
and wonderful events. The rapid progress of mind,
the developments through the sciences&mdash;which are
now throwing flood-lights upon Divine revelations, and
giving to the enlightened world a more comprehensive
knowledge of the Great Jehovah, and of His wonderful
works&mdash;are all potent with argument of the necessity
that the effort for a <small>UNITED CHURCH</small> should speedily be
made. A partial comprehension of these wonderful
developments, without further aids, may tend to throw
doubt and suspicion upon the minds of many, as to
whether or not any of the Christian organizations have
comprehended the true plan of salvation. Whilst a
divided church, a divided ministry, and their opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
teachings can but tend to strengthen such doubts,
bewilder the mind, and lead to <i>Infidelity</i>.</p>

<p>Now it rests with leading spirits and teachers of
<i>every</i> Christian denomination&mdash;whether <i>Protestant</i> or
<i>Catholic</i>&mdash;to say whether this advance shall be made in
behalf of <i>true religion</i>: the Church of God, and the salvation
of souls, or in the interest of Satan, the opposing
enemy; whether this advance shall be true <i>Christianity</i>,
or <i>Infidelity</i>; whether the upbuilding of the
Kingdom of Christ, and hastening the time when He
shall reign in the hearts of all; or, by indifference and
default, permitting the upbuilding of <i>Babylon</i>, and the
reseating of the "<span class="smcap">Scarlet Woman</span>," <i>and</i> thus tenfold
intensifying the great and <i>final struggle</i>.</p>

<p>There is a <i>true philosophy</i> in religion, and by instructing
the mind to comprehend this, the final happy
results will ensue.</p>

<p>We often hear ministers praying for the time to
come "when the world shall be converted to God;
when all shall know Him from the least unto the greatest."
They claim the promise that such a time <i>will
come</i>, and yet can but see that wickedness is gaining
ground, and that within their church organizations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
they do not number <i>one third of the population</i>&mdash;even in
what are denominated Christian countries, nor do they
keep pace with the increase of population, and yet they
seem contented with their "little flocks."</p>

<p>Ye ministers of the "<span class="smcap">Living God</span>," if ye have come
to "Mount Zion" by faith and prayer, and "holy living,"
we call upon you to unite your efforts in the spirit
of <i>brotherly love</i> and <span class="smcap">Christian unity</span>, and show to
a "perishing world" that you are in <i>earnest</i> in your
Master's cause, and that you desire the salvation of the
<i>whole human family</i>, else He may say to you, "<i>I will
come quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his
place.</i>"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In regard to the theory we have advanced as to the
location of Heaven, we leave you, and all, to examine
the revelations of God through the lights of science;
Nature around you, and with <i>reason</i> bearing upon the
fact that God, the Great Jehovah, the Creator of all,
though a <i>Spirit</i>, is not a <i>myth</i>; and that reality, law,
order, and system universally prevail throughout all
His works, and with these He governs His Universe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>God's own revelations, the lights afforded through
the sciences, Nature around us, true philosophy and
reason, all confirm our hypothesis. Cut loose now
from this, and we can anchor nowhere, save in a blind
incomprehensible faith, ever floating and drifting as in
a <i>sea of ether</i>, and surrounded by impenetrable <i>mystery</i>
and <i>gloom</i>.</p>

<p>All hold and teach that the spirit, when it leaves
the body, flies away from <i>mortality</i> and Earth, and goes
to the place prepared for it by its Creator. The celerity
with which spirit moves we do not now know, but
the reality and law of its flight does exist, and this by
God's own arrangement and established agency in Nature.
That such agency is continually with us, and
ready at all times for the use of disembodied spirit, we
cannot doubt&mdash;nay, possibly its principle or element is
<i>in</i> and <i>of</i> us, from the first moment of our existence,
through all subsequent time, and will continue to all
eternity to come.</p>

<p>The <i>blood</i> is the life of man, its element or stimulæ
of life is <i>electricity</i>, let this but escape from the blood,
and with it the soul or spirit has fled, and the body is
left to moulder back to dust. We find electricity to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a principle of <i>immateriality</i>; an element of <i>fire</i>, which
pervades all things, in a greater or less degree, not
only solids and fluids, but also atmosphere or air.</p>

<p>Now let us consider this element which God has
permitted man to comprehend as existing in nature,
and yet veils it from our sight, and, although he permits
us to use it for beneficial purposes, yet we can
never see or comprehend more than its <i>effects</i>, for, in
itself, it is <i>ethereal</i> and no mortal eye can behold it.
Man has not only been permitted to comprehend that
the principle of electricity does exist in Nature, but
also to measure, by time, its rapid flight. Thus, with
proper appliances, this Earth can be belted with it in
about <i>one tenth</i> part of a second of time. It would
seem to almost annihilate time, and space, as its flight
is nearly 300,000 miles a second&mdash;being more than one
third swifter than <i>light</i>.</p>

<p>In preceding pages, we have dwelt upon the distance
of our Earth from the Sun, and also distances to
various planets, and to some of the fixed stars, and
<i>nebulæ</i>, far away in sidereal regions. We have given
you the conclusions of the most scientific Astronomers
throughout the world. Their measurement of distances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
by light have been shown to approximate correctness,
and the truth of their deductions we cannot doubt.
They have explored regions so far remote, that it is
rendered certain that it has required <i>light several hundred
thousand years</i> from the time it left its native Sun,
to reach our Earth, and that these rays travelling from
thence, are now successively arriving and beaming
upon the eye when it is placed to the telescope. Indeed,
from one cluster of suns, or nebulæ, beyond the
"milky way," it is computed that the light derived from
thence has been 700,000 years in transit, although
travelling at the rate of 192,000 miles a second.</p>

<p>Now all these facts are astounding, and must impress
every reflecting mind with force. All can see
that Astronomers, by the aid of that wonderful gift of
God to man&mdash;the telescope&mdash;have looked abroad, and
have penetrated and surveyed with the eye space far
remote in sidereal regions, to the extent of which it
would require 300,000 years for <i>electricity</i> to reach at a
flight of 300,000 miles a second, and yet they have not
discovered any thing greatly different from our own
planetary system, nor any object or seeming phenomenon
they could denominate <i>heaven</i>. Without a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of these facts, is not the mind bewildered and <i>lost</i>
in the hazy contemplation? If heaven is still <i>far out
beyond</i>, what period or measure of Eternity may it requite
for the spirit, or soul to reach it after leaving the
body? Knowing that there is stern reality, regulated
law, order, and motion in all pertaining to Jehovah,
His creations and government; even the <i>mind of faith</i>
staggers, and must founder in the contemplation of
conceptions so mighty and so mysterious.</p>

<p>You have taught us to believe that heaven is a "fixed
place," and has a "permanent locality," but while accepting
this through faith, you have failed to give us a
<i>permanent thought</i>. Therefore, notwithstanding all our
hopes and desires, <i>mystery</i> and <i>gloom, dark and impenetrable</i>,
have shrouded the mind's eye of faith; leaving
no light but an excited and restless <i>imagination</i>, and we
call upon you to give <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> a <i>resting-place</i> somewhere
else than floating in <i>ethereal regions</i>, and wandering
about with <i>blind chance through illimitable space</i>.</p>

<p>Our hypothesis locates heaven just where <i>we believe
it is</i>, and <i>to it</i> the spirit can ascend, on <i>angel-wings of
electricity</i>, in a fraction of eternity equal to only <i>five
minutes of time</i>. And, although discoveries through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
lights of science directed our mind thither, and assisted
its comprehension, yet we believe <i>Divine Revelations
alone sustain our views</i>, and thus afford the mind a
resting place where <i>faith</i> and <i>hope</i> can anchor, and be
founded in reality, in <i>immutable and</i> <small>ETERNAL TRUTH</small>.
The laws of Nature, the controlling influence of that
world, our perceptive faculties and <i>reason</i>, all proclaim
that it must be so. Its protecting fires shield it from
mortal sight, yet proclaim to us through ten thousand
blessings showered upon our earth, <i>'tis there!</i> <span class="smcap">'Tis
There!!</span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Are any ready to ask why the "<i>glory-light</i>" of that
heavenly world, represented as "far above the brightness
of the Sun" cannot be seen? Such inquiry must
exhibit a lack of knowledge respecting the nature of
God, the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span>; as also of any proper conception
of the immortal spirit of man. That light is
<i>for spirit alone</i>, and cannot be seen by mortal eyes, and
that which is darkness to us while our sight is veiled
with mortality, so far as relates to that heavenly world
and our future, becomes&mdash;after the death of the body&mdash;transcendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
brilliancy, and the light of the "glory of
God."</p>

<p>We have abundant evidence of this fact. Remember
that when the Great Jehovah made His presence
manifest on Mount Sinai, although the mountain burned
with fire, yet&mdash;to mortal vision&mdash;all the surroundings
were filled with "thick clouds and darkness." Yea,
"clouds and darkness were made His pavilion," and, to
mortal eyes, "<i>are the habitations of His throne</i>."</p>

<p>The light of the "<i>glory of God</i>" is for spirit alone,
and <i>its</i> radiance will make even the light of the <i>Sun</i>
darkness to the <i>spirit-eye</i>. It is possible that should He
unveil Himself, and throw a flash of His <i>glory-light</i> upon
this world, it would in an instant of time destroy
the whole race of man, and every living thing, for He
hath said, "<i>No one shall see me and live.</i>"</p>

<p>We have on record evidences sustaining our views
in regard to such effects, should the light and brightness
of His face or glory be revealed. See the effects
of the light of His glory, even in a veiled form, when
the Son of God made himself manifest from heaven
(that bright world we have been contemplating, wherein
he is enthroned, and where all the righteous shall dwell)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to Saul of Tarsus; although He did not unveil himself,
yet "<i>a light above the brightness of the Sun at mid-day
shone around, and Saul fell to the earth smitten with
blindness</i>." Yes, this glory-light <i>is darkness</i> to mortal
eyes; and when beheld by spirit, the light of the <i>Sun</i>
may even be darkness. See again its effects upon St.
John, the revelator, when, catching but a glimpse of
the Son of man in the midst of the golden candlesticks,
he "<i>fell at his feet as dead</i>." Ah, it is possible that all
seeming <i>natural light</i> to us, while in mortality, may
become as <i>darkness</i> to our spirit vision; and we are
assured by the word of God, that none shall see the
light of His glory save those who seek regeneration
through <small>LOVE</small> and <small>FAITH</small>, for the wicked shall go into
<i>outer darkness</i>, and dwell forever in death, while the
righteous shall enter into and enjoy eternal life.</p>

<p>Our hypothesis is a pleasing one for the contemplation
of every Christian, and yet cannot interfere in the
least with the doctrines of any who believe there is a
heaven. And he who believeth not in either God or
heaven, has lost the intellectual dignity of man in proper
conceptions, and knoweth not even now "what manner
of man he is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>We have given something tangible upon which to
fix the mind, and which will inspire hope; something
of <i>reality</i> that all may contemplate. Remember that
we are not forbidden to investigate, nor yet form conclusions
founded on reason; neither is it declared that
we shall not <i>know</i> the location of our future home.</p>

<p>From all that man can comprehend of nature, <i>reason</i>
teaches him to look for and find&mdash;if not in life, <i>after
death</i>&mdash;his future home somewhere in connection with
our own planetary system. This system is large and
grand enough to justify all our aspirations, and satisfy
all our hopes and desires. The extent, grandeur, and
glory of the heaven we have contemplated, will fully
satisfy the immortal mind of man, even as it does the
"angels of God," and its King and Ruler, and we may
all consider ourselves fortunate to get there.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We have written our book, and thrown out these
suggestions with purest of motives. From the first
conception of the idea of heaven being where, in mind,
we locate it, we have felt impressed with the correctness
of our views; so much so, that it impelled us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
make the effort to give them to the world, believing
that in doing so we should advance the true theory
which would sustain Christianity, and cause it to spread
and triumph over all opposition; give "to faith that
<i>hope</i> which is an anchor to the soul," and draw the
hearts and minds of all to <i>love</i> God, and yet in that
love <i>fear</i> to offend Him.</p>

<p>We have refrained from consulting the clergy or
ministers of <i>any</i> and every denomination in this matter,
desiring simply to give our own views. We now ask of
you all a prayerful and thorough examination by the
evidences of Divine Revelations and all other lights
afforded you; and if you discard our views as to the
location of heaven, be <i>careful</i> and <i>explicit</i> in giving us
<i>your hypothesis</i> as to the one you are inviting us to, and
<i>locate it</i> where the <i>mind of reason</i> can contemplate it,
and where <i>hope</i> may span the voyage <i>the soul must make</i>
to reach it after the death of the body.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>
<h2>APPEAL TO ALL:</h2>

<h3>WHETHER JEWS OR GENTILES, PROTESTANTS, CATHOLICS,
INFIDELS, OR INDIFFERENT BELIEVERS.</h3>


<p>We desire the salvation of the entire human family.
We believe that God has provided a way
and plan of salvation by which all should gain
a true and saving knowledge of Him; and we have
<i>appealed</i> to Christian ministers to unite their efforts in
prayerful investigation of His revelations through all
new lights afforded them, and to point out to all, the
plain path of <i>duty</i> and <i>safety</i>&mdash;but not in any wise labor
under the false or mistaken belief that they can stand
as <i>sole mediator</i>, or umpire, between God and the souls
of men, and, at their own will or pleasure, mete out to
them eternal happiness or misery. Such as do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
"are blind leaders of the blind," and their doctrine a
<i>fatal delusion</i>.</p>

<p>We believe in a living, teaching ministry; and,
where heart and life is fully consecrated to God and
His cause, all such may feel that they are divinely
called and commissioned. We hold that such a ministry
should be sustained, and that all should give liberally
out of their abundance, to secure them against
want or contingencies which might retard or prevent
their usefulness.</p>

<p>But our appeal is now to you, in regard to your own
<i>individual responsibility</i>. Each has an immortal soul,
which must be saved or lost. No one, save Christ
Jesus our Lord, can stand as mediator in behalf of any
to insure salvation or heaven. Popes, bishops, ministers,
and priests <i>are but men</i>, and are mortal like ourselves.
They may, by application to study and investigation,
gain light and knowledge&mdash;nay, should do it,
so as to instruct us in the way of life and salvation,
but further than this they cannot go. We have no evidence,
neither in the Old or New Testament Scriptures,
where, by intercession of <i>man alone</i>, salvation or heaven
was ever obtained by an unbelieving heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>We see that, under the earlier dispensation, Moses
was the chosen servant of God, and divinely commissioned
as <i>High-Priest</i> to the children of Israel. Yet
when they sinned, and Jehovah's wrath was kindled
against them, Moses made <i>direct intercession</i> in their
behalf, and even plead, saying: "<i>If thou wilt not forgive
them, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou
hast written.</i>" Hear the answer of the Lord: "<i>Whosoever
hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my
book; * * * * mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless,
in the day when I visit, I will visit their sins upon
them.</i>" Thus, although His judgments were stayed for
a season, because of His covenant, yet their final execution
was certain.</p>

<p>We are assured by the Scriptures that there is
"<i>One God</i>" and "<i>One Mediator</i>," and we may go to
God through faith in this <i>One Mediator</i>, and that all
who go thus shall obtain eternal life. We have record
of the efficacy of this faith in the application of the
dying thief. When he had signified his belief, hear the
answer of the Saviour: "<i>To-day shalt thou be with me
in Paradise.</i>" Oh, how plain the plan of salvation!</p>

<p>All nature proclaims there is a God. His revelations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
proclaim an eternal existence of the soul. We
all know that we <i>must die</i>. However disappointed we
may be in our earthly hopes or fears, yet as to the certainty
of death none will be disappointed&mdash;<i>it is sure to
come</i>. When the angel of death is commissioned to
summon us, soon "<i>the pale horse and his rider</i>" will be
at the door; then there can be no delay. "<i>Dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</i>" "<i>And the soul
shall return to God who gave it.</i>" "<i>It is appointed unto
men once to die, but after this the judgment.</i>"</p>

<p>What can you <i>lose</i> by giving your heart to God?
What may you not lose by neglecting to do it? It is
<i>all gain</i> and <i>no loss</i>. May you all yield to the gentle
drawings of the spirit, which now whispers to your
heart in loving tones with accents of <i>mercy</i>, and your
spirits finally be gathered in the fold of angels' wings,
and by them borne to the Paradise of God, where His
glory is the light of eternal day.</p>
